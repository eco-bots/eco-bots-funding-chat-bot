Marine social-ecological models aim to integrate modelling approaches originating from different disciplines focusing on different levels of analysis and implementing different methodological frameworks in a meaningful way. The challenges include interoperability of transdisciplinary data (ecological social economic legal etc.); integration of models with different spatial and temporal resolutions calculation of uncertainties and more.Social-ecological models developed with a multi-actor approach that would help assess the impacts of environmental changes human pressures and/or policy implementation on the overall ocean health blue economy and societal prosperity;Improved understanding of complex social-ecological systems aiming at better management of human activities policy implementation responding to societal needs (local communities economic activities growing resources needs…) and avoiding negative outcomes of policies such as the loss of jobs overfishing hypoxia or stock collapse.Scope:The vision for the European Digital Twin Ocean is to make ocean knowledge readily available to citizens entrepreneurs scientists and policy-makers and to provide them with an innovative set of user-driven and interactive tools fostered by digital transition empowering them to collectively share the responsibility of marine and coastal habitats and act on their restoration to support a sustainable blue economy and to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It aims to provide consistent high-resolution multi-dimensional description of the ocean: its physical chemical biological and social-ecological and economical dimensions with forecasting periods from season to multi-decades transforming data into knowledge. This call aims to support the necessary actions and tool developments to appropriately include the social-ecological component of the European Digital Twin Ocean including the links and interactions with other parts of the system (data underlying models ecosystem models local twins etc.) the necessary social-economic data considerations and the development of models and other applications to simulate and predict the social and economic part of marine and coastal systems linked to the environmental/ecological components enabling the development of normative (what-if scenarios) and decision-support tools.Proposals should address all activities and tasks as described below in cooperation and complementarity with the linked actions and other relevant actions:Address the long-term and reliable accessibility and availability of spatially explicit social and economic data fit-for-purpose for the development of social-ecological models and other relevant approaches as described below. The social and economic data should be integrated with the available marine data sources and models of the DTO in an interoperable and standardised manner. This should include considerations related to spatial and temporal scale of analysis and data collection development of methodological protocols to connect socio-economic data with environmental data etc.Development of a wide range of social-ecological models tools and applications from simple impact assessment models to agent-based models to integrated social-ecological models with capacity to run and assess a variety of normative (what-if) scenarios evaluating the impact and long-term effect of environmental change policy alternatives and management decisions to coastal and marine systems both environmentally and societally.Assessment of existing or development of new parallel frameworks of analysis other than models (e.g. statistical approaches AI) to be integrated into the framework of the DTO. As not all aspects of socio-economic systems and behaviours can be assessed through numerical models other methodologies should be investigated and developed to ensure inclusion of these parts of the system into the DTO and link them appropriately with the social-ecological models.Development of integrated ecological and socio-economic indicators that can be used in the assessment of the impacts of environmental policy or management change in coastal and marine social-ecological systems.Development of new processes and tools for decision-support participatory management and policy scenarios assessment including the methodological approaches to effective stakeholders’ engagement.Proposals should address considerations of social-ecological modelling in the overall framework of the European Digital Twin Ocean but also develop applications appropriate for use in local Twins (thematic or regional/local scale approaches to twinning).Proposals should support the Mission’s Blue Parks and Mission lighthouses and efficient ocean stewardship. Projects should collaborate with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03 to adopt best practices regarding FAIR and open data sharing and benefit from existing EU programmes (e.g. Copernicus EMODnet EUROSTAT).Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 3-5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.,,General conditions1.

Quality Label Humanitarian Aid - Full Procedure,European Solidarity Corps (ESC),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/esc-humaid-2021-qual-label-fp;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,10 June 2021,21 September 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,Scope:QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERINGWHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering certifies that an organisation is able to carry out high quality solidarity activities in compliance with the principles objectives and requirements of the action ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’. Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering applicant organisations can choose one of the following roles:Support role - entails supporting preparing and/or training participants before departure mediation between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant including the development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the phases as appropriateHOW DOES IT WORK?The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process involving three main stages: submission of application assessment and award.The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming period to the Executive Agency which is the sole implementing body for this action. The applications will be evaluated at set intervals according to an annual timetable which is aligned to the timetable of the Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.Applications will be assessed against eligibility selection exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection and exclusion criteria see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia profiles of all organisations holding this Quality Label are published in a database of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential partners partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal can be used.Once awarded a Quality Label organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label application form.APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATION - THE SIMPLIFIED HOST PROCEDUREAn organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting procedure). This procedure is designed to help larger organisations with several branches located in different countries.The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of activities offered by simplified hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS?The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities through the Quality Label process. Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair transparent and objective way regardless of their gender ethnicity religion sexual orientation political opinion or disability. No previous qualifications educational level specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project context. In order to promote inclusion participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs so that any adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants participating organisations and target groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental crises conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child (https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_guidelines_rights_of_child_0.pdf)Provision of high quality easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable participants to develop skills and competencies for personal social and civic development. Particular attention will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with local humanitarian actors the hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised for volunteers through validation of learning outcomes.Adequate training working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.“no profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore volunteering should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORGANISATIONS HOLDING A QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERINGIn addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles organisations implementing humanitarian aid volunteering projects must carry out specific tasks and responsibilities in order to ensure high quality activities.

To that end proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:National and EU authorities apply user-friendly tools to produce and use generated data on the impact of pollutants on health;National and EU authorities benefit from access to robust and transparent indicators for health impact assessment to monitor efficacy of pollution-mitigating actions and policies;Policymakers and other stakeholders e.g. public authorities such as urban planners health professionals employers civil society organisations and citizens use developed guidelines to take action to prevent pollution-related illnesses and impairments and choose healthier lifestyles and behaviours;EU national and regional authorities receive guidance and recommendations for updates of (1) scientific evidence about health risks caused by environmental pollutants (2) advice on management and mitigation of these health risks and (3) guidance and recommendations for updates of limit values for different classes of pollutants in the environment; these recommendations should take into account vulnerable population groups and people with increased vulnerability because of pre-existing medical conditions;The implementation of the Zero-Pollution Action Plan the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability and the EU legislation on air quality noise and waste continue to be supported by a strong evidence-base;Relevant actors in our daily lives e.g. medical personnel building engineers teachers urban planners etc. have access to information such as training courses on pollution and health impacts.Scope:The European Green Deal set out by the European Commission recognises that man-made environmental pollution is an increasing threat for human health and wellbeing. Opinion polls[1] show that climate change air pollution and waste are the three most important environmental issues that European citizens are concerned about. Over three-quarters (78%) of respondents believe that environmental issues have a direct effect on their daily life and health.Pollution affects a large number of people in Europe and beyond: A 2018 assessment attributed 16% of total global mortality to pollution-related disease. Over 7 million people die of exposure to polluted air every year worldwide[2]. For 2019 the European Environment Agency has estimated that around 350 000 premature deaths in the EU can be attributed to air pollution (namely from particulate matter nitrogen dioxide and ozone)[3]. Today more than 1 in 4 Europeans is exposed to traffic noise levels dangerous to their health in their homes schools and workplaces[4]. The increase of artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities has altered the natural light levels in the environment and extended human activities to the usually dark hours. It has been estimated that more than 80% of the world population is living under light polluted skies[5]. Waste[6] continues to be a persistent environmental issue in Europe and it is estimated that there are 2.5 million contaminated sites in Europe with potentially significant adverse health effects[7].The global burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has consistently increased over the last decades being now estimated to account for 70% of deaths globally (World Health Organization). The growing burden of chronic diseases will also be a challenge for Europe’s healthcare systems these diseases already accounting for an estimated 70-80% of healthcare costs. Currently around 50 million European citizens suffer from two or more chronic conditions and most of these people are over 65.[8] The most recent WHO environmental burden of disease estimations suggest that annually 13% of deaths (630 000) in the WHO Europe region are attributable to environmental stressors and an EEA report concluded that 90% of deaths attributable to the environment result from non-communicable diseases including cancers cardiovascular diseases stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mental behavioural and neurological disorders diabetes kidney disease and asthma[9]. While early childhood deaths have declined the years lived with disability have increased particularly with chronic disease.The proposed research should strengthen the knowledge base available to policymakers regarding pollution-disease associations and causal mechanisms at different phases of the life course taking advantage of latest molecular cellular and computational technologies to elucidate biological pathways from exposure (including combined exposures) to disease. The work should bring together toxicology exposure science public health engineering and environmental epidemiology and build on data from sources such as pollution-related databases disease registries epidemiological studies and biobanks environmental and human biomonitoring data and new generated data and could consider citizen science and other innovative approaches. All exposure routes should be considered where relevant (oral/digestive tract inhalation dermal).The focus of this topic should be on three areas where the understanding of and evidence on causality should be strengthened to overcome the current paucity of data and respond to calls from policymakers. The applicants should focus on at least one of the following three aspects:Air pollution especially in the urban environment taking into account existing evidence notably the latest WHO air quality guidelines of 2021 and their recommendations on different pollutants[10] including on pollutants of emerging concern looking at e.g. ultrafine particles and interactions with aeroallergens black carbon sand and dust storms and impact on human health;Noise pollution and light pollution impact on human health;Pollution from hazardous waste (e.g. pharmaceuticals illicit drugs e-waste plastics (including nano- and microplastics)) in heavily contaminated environments and adverse health outcomes.Several of the following activities should be included:Research activities to strengthen the evidence base for pollution-disease associations and underlying causality mechanisms and biological pathways taking into account combined exposures and mechanisms of increased sensitivity in susceptible groups;Delivery of FAIR data[11] on causal associations between environmental risk factors and health outcomes in particular for air pollutants of emerging concern specifically ultrafine particles black carbon and others taking into account vulnerable population groups and specific exposure situations in a life-course approach including vulnerable early-stages of life and transgenerational risks;Development of user-friendly tools for systematic mining and assessment of the knowledge generated and translation into best practices and to improve the assessment of individual life-exposure to pollutants;Proposals for environmental limit values for the studied pollutants and generation of health impact indicators where relevant and taking into account existing standards and evidence;Development of guidelines and socio-economic and decision support tools for different actors including policymakers health professionals and citizens to take action to prevent pollution-related illnesses and impairments and to enable the choice of healthier lifestyles and behaviours;Identification of cross-sectoral interventions (case studies) with the potential for remediating pollution and risk of exposure and improving human health and well-being in the short/medium term;Development of training courses on pollution and health impacts to inform professionals impacting our daily lives e.g. medical personnel engineers teachers urban planners;Design of best-practice evidence-based communication actions for fact-based risk and benefit communication and improving citizen awareness of pollution and preventive actions offsetting dissemination of misinformation;Undertaking case studies to demonstrate the added societal value of tools methodologies and guidelines developed and the implementation of resulting actions to decrease health impacts of exposures.Aspects such as gender regional variations socioeconomics and culture should be considered where appropriate. Proposals should ensure that chemical monitoring data are shared in IPCHEM[12] through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). In that respect the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal and this collaboration when relevant should be established after the proposal’s approval.This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.In order to optimise synergies and increase the impact of the projects all projects selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities. Without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities proposals should allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and to cover the costs of any other potential common networking and joint activities.Applicants invited to the second stage and envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area ‘A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats’ and in particular to the following expected impact set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: ‘living and working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better understanding of environmental occupational social and economic determinants of health’. In addition research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: ‘Good health and high-quality accessible health care’ ‘Climate change mitigation and adaptation’ and ‘Clean and healthy air water and soil’. The environment we live and work in is a major determinant of our health and well-being. Environmental factors are estimated to account for almost 20% of all deaths in Europe. The impacting factors on both physical and mental health and wellbeing are not all identified nor their effects comprehensively understood and accounted for to support evidence-based policy- and decision-making. Therefore Destination 2 aims at filling knowledge gaps in the understanding of the impacts on our health and well-being of those environmental occupational and socio-economic risk factors that have the most significant or widespread societal impacts. In this work programme Destination 2 focuses on pollution disrupting chemicals environmental degradation climate and other environmental exposures in living and working environments. The results will support the EU’s environment and health policies and overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability the EU Adaptation Strategy the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 the 8th Environment Action Programme the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work as well as the WHO European Environment and Health Process (EHP). Strong collaborations across sectors and with other Horizon Europe clusters dealing with issues such as agriculture food environment climate biodiversity mobility security urban planning social inclusion and gender will be needed to ensure that maximal societal benefits are reached. Thus in view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops the exchange of knowledge development and adoption of best practices or joint communication activities. All topics are open to international collaboration to address global environment and health challenges.Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to living and working in a health-promoting environment and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Policymakers and regulators are aware and well informed about environmental socio-economic and occupational risk factors as well as health-promoting factors across society;Environmental occupational social economic fiscal and health policies and practices at the EU national and regional level are sustainable and based on solid scientific evidence. These include overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability the 8th Environment Action Programme the EU Adaptation Strategy the Farm to Fork Strategy[[https://food.ec.europa.eu/horizontal-topics/farm-fork-strategy_en]] the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work and the European Environment and Health Process led by the World Health Organization;The upstream determinants of disease - related to choices in energy generation agricultural and food processing practices industrial production land use planning built environment and construction - are known understood and reduced;The health threats and burden resulting from hazardous chemicals biodiversity degradation and air water and soil pollution and contamination is reduced so that the related number of deaths and illnesses is substantially reduced by 2030;Living and working environments in European cities and regions are healthier more inclusive safer resilient and sustainable;The adaptive capacity and resilience of populations and health systems in Europe to climate and environmental change-related health risks is strengthened;Citizens’ health and well-being is protected and promoted and premature deaths diseases and inequalities related to environmental pollution and degradation as well as unhealthy lifestyles are prevented;Citizens understand better complex environment and health issues and effective measures to address them and support related policies and regulation.,"General conditions1.

This cannot be neglected when implementing a sustainable energy future. This also reflects the public interest and the contemporary principle of environmental sustainability related to any industrial activity. Though various dismantling techniques are at the level of industrial maturity there are still specific challenges to achieving high safety standards efficiency and cost-effectiveness of dismantling operations.As identified in the Euratom project portfolio and the SHARE project[4] a roadmap for research and innovation in decommissioning has been published based on the needs and gaps identified across the whole decommissioning value chain and built on the input of the international stakeholder community. The thematic areas that should be prioritised are in situ waste characterisation and segregation robotics and remote systems difficult to measure radionuclides clearance of surfaces and structures cost estimation and knowledge management. In particular specific needs include developing remote integrated and automatic technologies for waste characterisation and segregation but also modular and mobile systems and robotic solutions to address the hard-to-access areas in a new and cost-effective way and developing data collection protocols and a global cost estimation methodology.Decommissioning is a multidisciplinary process and experts anticipate that ‘open innovation beyond technology’ and digital and robotics’ technologies can provide crucial insights for the overall planning and implementation of decommissioning projects. Establishing guidelines and sharing best practices on the implementation of digital technologies like Building Information Modelling digital twins and artificial intelligence is also expected to improve key decommissioning tasks. International cooperation will result in a relative harmonisation of decommissioning waste management systems including its packaging transport and storage. Harmonisation of clearance criteria for radioactive materials from decommissioning will also improve recycling in and out of the nuclear sector.In addition Euratom research supported here will also benefit from JRC support as the EU-mandated actor in helping create knowledge share experience and spread knowledge among different EU stakeholders in a coordinated way[5]. As a result it should build regulators’ trust in introducing innovative and modern techniques by boosting safety and efficiency and improving the evaluation of safety margins and licensing procedures.[1] Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom of 25 June 2009 establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations ((OJ L 172 2.7.2009 p.18) as amended by Council Directive 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014 amending Directive 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations (OJ L 219 25.7.2014 p. 42).[2] Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom of 5 December 2013 laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom 90/641/Euratom 96/29/Euratom 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom.[3] Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom of 19July 2011 establishing a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste (OJ L 199 2.8.2011 p. 48–56)[4] Euratom SHARE project (2019-22): https://share-h2020.eu/ and https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/847626[5] Council Regulation (Euratom) 2021/100 of 25 January 2021 covering the period 2021-27 establishing a dedicated financial programme for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the management of radioactive waste: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/100/oj,,Conditions1. Admissibility conditions: described in General Annex A (Admissibility) of Euratom WP 2023-2025Proposal page limits and layout: described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System.For IA the limit for a full application is 45 pages.

System approach for grid planning and upgrade in support of a dominant electric mobility (vehicles and vessels) using AI tools,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2023-d3-03-03;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,04 May 2023,10 October 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute of the following expected outcomes:AI-based prediction of most convenient locations that optimize grid resources and upgrades around recharging pools for EVs and electric HDVs.Developing of spatial mapping models and software tool for location decision-making with a comprehensive focus including major highways industrial zones (depot charging) urban nodes (e.g. for overnight charging) and less-densely populated areas.Simulation analysis design test and demonstration of smart and bidirectional charging schemes and their integration into flexibility markets that allow to minimise the impact on grid planning and connection of high-power recharging pools for recharging EVs and especially HDVs on more cost-intensive locations and that ensure benefits to consumers based on smart charging energy service models.Exploration of the impact of different charging methods including cable-charging wireless charging and electric road systems covering either catenary as inductive coils embedded in the road.Analysis design testing and developing of a cyber security model that can simulate and accurately represent attack propagation from recharging infrastructure entry vectors informing the development of efficient strategies and lines of defence to mitigate these vulnerabilities for the different relevant stakeholders.Scope:The activities are expected to include at least the following aspects:Definition and development of new AI-based tools to predict estimate and plan the deployment and associated challenge for utilities (from an EV recharging ecosystem viewpoint - CPO DSO and TSO) on how to deal with the increasing upcoming demand in numerous new locations particularly during peak periods.Understanding on how to effectively deploy the required grid connection (and power) in less densely populated areas exploring the impact of installation of batteries to expand the grid in combination with renewables.Development of a coherent energy system planning for electric mobility considering both the needs and impact for recharging of EVs and onshore power supply of vessels in maritime ports and inland waterways.Development of new services for consumers (EV and HDV owners leasers etc.) based on smart charging that valorise the flexibility in the wholesale home optimisation and/or grid services markets. Integration of smart charging services with flexibility from other devices (e.g. demand response) would be an added value for the project.There is an increasing risk for the occurrence of a scenario where EVs and/or recharging stations could be hacked simultaneously causing a disruption to grid operations propagating rapidly with dire consequences such as blackouts and overall affection of the frequency stability of the grid. The project should bridge the gap between recharging infrastructure operators EVs and the grid (DSOs TSOs) identify existing weaknesses and risks for attack spread.The developed solutions should assess their environmental impact in particular with regards to their energy consumption.The selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative[1] actively participate to its activities and allocate up to 2% of their budgets to that end. Additional contributions to the ‘Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation’ (AIOTI) and other relevant activities (e.g. clusters of digital projects and coordinating actions) might be considered when relevant.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-8 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.[1]https://www.h2020-bridge.eu/,Sustainable secure and competitive energy supply (2023/24)This Destination includes activities targeting a sustainable secure and competitive energy supply. In line with the scope of cluster 5 this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner more secure and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings mobility industry) and integration of other climate neutral renewable energy carriers such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical mechanical electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility energy construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ ‘Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy’ as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 – 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital enabling and emerging technologies sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;Affordable and clean energy.The expected impact in line with the Strategic Plan is to contribute to “More efficient clean sustainable secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions” notably throughFostering European global leadership in affordable secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers consumers networks infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below).Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power heating/cooling transportation agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and especially local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability security sustainability and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy photovoltaics solar thermal bioenergy or hydropower) and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore advanced renewable fuels including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the “do not significantly harm” principle for the environment research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use circularity pollution and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.Regarding the REPowerEU communication renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels. Most of the topics in this work programme are centred along two of the REPowerEU tracks with the remainder of the topics fully contributing to decreasing the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels:PV wind energy and heat pumps encompassing the most readily available renewable energy technologies to reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels. (17 topics)Renewable fuels encompassing the most readily available technologies (advanced biofuels) but also the less mature ones (synthetic renewable fuels). Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels and in particular advanced biofuels contribute to reduce the EU’s dependence because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels utilizing the existing infrastructure. (8 topics)The remainder of the topics also contributes to the objective of decreasing the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels with the focus either on specific renewable energy sectors (bioenergy geothermal hydropower ocean energy and solar thermal) or on cross-technology activities (next generation renewable energy market measures international cooperation).

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques could enable ground-breaking capabilities in the future including defences that automatically interdict attackers and reshape networks to mitigate offensive operations. ML combined with AI could shape cyber operations in ways that drive more aggressive and destabilising engagements between state actors. Therefore it is valuable to anticipate how adversaries might adapt their tactics and strategies and to determine what challenges might emerge for defenders.The field of AI is at a critical crossroad. Globalisation and industrialisation of AI is intensifying while the ethical and regulatory issues of these technologies are multiplied. AI has moved from an emerging technology to a mature technology which is no longer dealing with a speculative part of scientific research but instead something that has real-world impact both positive and negative. The importance of AI in cyber operations has been noticed by many nations. AI is a strategic technology that could prove incredibly consequential for the competitiveness of the EU its Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway).Specific objectiveToday’s conversations on AI in military affairs concentrate on various variants of “narrow” artificial intelligence. Current discussions on AI often primarily concentrate on ML which is the process of using algorithms to learn from data. Much of the most exciting progress in recent years has leveraged deep learning a technique that involves the use of layers of artificial neural networks which are inspired by the structure of the human brain.At a basic level AI involves software that leverages data for learning but also requires hardware to harness the power of significant computing capabilities to enable that process. It is inherently challenging to define what AI is or can achieve when the field is so dynamic and evolving so rapidly. For the time being AI/ML techniques are often limited by the availability of data although this may change with advances in the use of synthetic data real-life cyber exercises data lakes and techniques that leverage reinforcement learning such as the capability to learn from self-play alone.The main challenge of this topic is to establish an investigative approach on an area of autonomous deployable AI creation with the intention to broaden artificial intelligence perspective in cyber defence in the EU.Scope:The proposals must focus on the development of an autonomous and adaptive deployable AI agent. All proposed activities must ultimately support the creation of an AI agent that is able to conduct automated and semi-automated incident management on different cyber defence systems for the entire process of the incident management cycle. The solutions must support human operators analysts and decision-makers at technical tactical operational strategic and political level. In addition solutions are expected to contribute to enhanced cyber situational awareness increased military infrastructure resilience and improved protection against AI-based and other advanced cyber threats.The work should identify gaps for achieving an autonomous AI agent for military systems. The final result should build on a general-purpose AI agent that can be deployed in different operating environments.The work should also address the gap of learning data sets through the use of live-fire exercises data lake concepts and self-learning algorithms. Access to the data sets should be planned in a decentralised way to allow the solution to be deployable. This implies that new architectures and solutions should be considered in achieving decentralisation utilising and enhancing for example AI-powered edge computing.The assessment of the proposed solution must be evaluated during live-fire exercises with a method allowing comparison of the developed AI agent against actual defending teams. This means using learning data from different exercises but also data feeds from the exercise itself where the AI agent is competing.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):Types of activities(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)	Eligible?(a)	Activities that aim to create underpin and improve knowledge products and technologies including disruptive technologies which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (generating knowledge)	No(b)	Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience including secured production and exchange of data to master critical defence technologies to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (integrating knowledge)	Yes(optional)(c)	Studies such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products technologies processes services and solutions	Yes(mandatory)(d)	Design of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment	Yes(mandatory)(e)	System prototyping of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	Yes(mandatory)(f)	Testing of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	Yes(mandatory)(g)	Qualification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	Yes(optional)(h)	Certification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	Yes(optional)(i)	Development of technologies or assets increasing efficiency across the life cycle of defence products and technologies	Yes(optional)The proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of the mandatory activities:Studies:the proposed activities must include feasibility studies drawing upon real-world scenarios and live-fire exercises in order to ensure that developed solution and techniques are fit-for-purpose.Design:the proposed solutions must include creation of AI-based techniques for detecting and understanding adversarial activity;the proposed solution must include creation of AI-based techniques for building knowledge about own protected ICT systems (e.g. a “cyber record” with current and historical information).

Dedicated hardware architectures for energy-efficient AI,European Defence Fund (EDF),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/edf-2023-ra-digit-haai;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,22 June 2023,22 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,Objective:Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for most defence capabilities. However the energy consumption of AI implemented on classical processors limits its practical usage especially for embedded systems and edge computing. Indeed existing processors are far from optimal for most AI applications in terms of efficiency and energy consumption due to their architecture (digital representation of information separation of memory and computing). While this issue has been overridden for decades by the steady technological progress of these processors in terms of miniaturisation and performance following Moore’s law this trend is reaching its limit and the need to move to dedicated architectures is coming to the fore.In particular moving from digital to analogue computing has the potential to improve computing in terms of speed and/or energy-efficiency by several orders of magnitude (expectedly by a factor of at least thousands). Furthermore it can benefit from the increasing versatility of artificial neural networks to address a variety of AI applications. In addition it offers enhanced security by coding the information in a way that strongly limits information leaks as this information is deeply intertwined with the processing hardware. Besides sensing functionalities can be integrated into analogue processors to produce very low power consumption smart sensors or to increase the frequency range of radiofrequency signals that can be processed.In addition this is an emerging technological domain within the field of processors where competition is relatively open and where there is an opportunity to build on European competencies.The goal of the topic is thus to create new types of processors for AI that offer very significant performance gains for defence applications and to develop European supply chains offering a technological autonomy for these technologies.Scope:The proposals must address research on new hardware architectures for AI that offer very significant gains in term of power consumption processing speed and latency as well as in terms of size weight and cost. Any type of architecture deemed suitable to address the objectives may be investigated (e.g. magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) memristors in-memory computing etc. possibly combined with other relevant hardware and software technologies in hybrid architectures).Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):Types of activities(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)	Eligible?(a)	Activities that aim to create underpin and improve knowledge products and technologies including disruptive technologies which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (generating knowledge)	Yes(optional)(b)	Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience including secured production and exchange of data to master critical defence technologies to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (integrating knowledge)	Yes(optional)(c)	Studies such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products technologies processes services and solutions	Yes(mandatory)(d)	Design of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment	Yes(mandatory)(e)	System prototyping of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(f)	Testing of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(g)	Qualification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(h)	Certification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(i)	Development of technologies or assets increasing efficiency across the life cycle of defence products and technologies	NoThe proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of the mandatory activities:Studies:study of new processing architectures and their physical implementation;Design:design and small-scale fabrication of such innovative processors;integration in technology demonstrators and measurement of performances on AI data and tasks relevant for defence applications.The proposals should describe how synergies and complementarities with activities funded by other sources of funding including civil ones such as Horizon Europe are sought and maximised.Functional requirementsThe proposed solutions should meet the following functional requirements:They should offer very significant gains over classical hardware architectures in terms of computing power (speed and/or energy efficiency) and compactness (size weight and cost) including for complete systems (e.g. including thermal dissipation management). The gains are expected to be of several orders of magnitude. The proposals should clearly describe and justify the expected gains;These gains should be measured on well-identified defence AI use cases with clear metrics and on data sets that are representative of military mission profiles. The proposals should describe clearly these use cases metrics and data. They should also describe how the absence of bias in the measurements and comparability with state-of-the-art approaches can be ensured;Solutions addressing the detection and recognition of radiofrequency signals should address frequencies up to several tens of GHz.Expected Impact:The outcome should contribute to:the ability to integrate high-end AI features into various embedded defence equipment while offering reasonable battery life and at a reasonable cost;enhanced security of AI-based systems;strengthened European supply chains and technological autonomy in the domain of high-efficiency computing and processors for AI.,,1. Admissibility conditions: described in section 5 of the call documentProposal page limits and layout: described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System2.

Strategic air transportation of outsized cargo,European Defence Fund (EDF),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/edf-2023-ra-protmob-satoc;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,22 June 2023,22 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,Objective:Strategic Air transport for Outsized Cargo (SATOC) is a core capability for the rapid projection of military capabilities over long distances and mission support worldwide. All operations carried out so far have always had to fall back on this important capability for deployment and subsequent sustainment. Beyond their military role SATOC aircraft are also key assets for providing better civilian support for EU-internal needs including critical and essential contributions to immediate logistic support over large distances disaster relief and fast general crisis response. However there is currently no adequate service provider who has the appropriate capability to meet the needs of the Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway). Therefore this topic proposes to study the possibility of a future aircraft development or the acquisition of an appropriate contractor support.Specific objectiveStrategic airlift requirements and strategic airlift notably of oversized cargo have been provided almost entirely by third countries creating a critical dependency for the EU. The Russia-Ukraine war has significantly reduced the ANTONOV logistics fleet. This has created a looming strategic capability gap in the upcoming years with no clear solutions for a replacement. In addition a certain degree of uncertainty about the supportability of the remaining fleet constitutes a significant factor. This is true in particular with respect to the availability of replacement parts and replaceable units as well as the availability and integrity of design information should for example new structural issues arise.In order to preserve European sovereignty and enable global force projection it is critical to establish a strategic airlift capability by either re-designing / adapting an existing or developing a new solution.Furthermore from a European perspective it is of vital importance to underline the fact that strategic airlift capability is not exclusively restricted to military purposes but is also an asset in various crisis scenarios as well as on humanitarian aid missions.Scope:Based on the Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway) requirements the objective of this topic is to explore the range of options towards creating a new European SATOC capability. The proposals are to identify define and evaluate short-term and lasting strategic airlift solutions. More precisely the study must map the individual solutions against their respective parameters such as economic or military performance and availability. The study is expected to not only assess re-design options of various existing aircraft and civilian outsized cargo solutions but also to identify development options resulting in possibly two different life-cycle timeframes. Furthermore the platform solutions must also be evaluated in various possible operating schemes including either the full acquisition of aircraft and/or the provision of services while taking into consideration the respective certification (military vs. civilian) aspects. It is understood that SATOC will play a support role and not a combat/in-theatre role. The study may involve the identification of potential economies of scale through parallel civilian and military applications (dual-use) of the chosen solution in an effort to reduce the overall development and operating costs associated with a small fleet. The study is to address a possible future operation and service provision from a common military (e.g. NATO’s AWACS base MMF base) or civilian hub.The proposals should draft conceptual assessment of options able to achieve initial and possibly partial capability in the short term and a full capability in-service solution in the next decade. However the timeline can be accelerated if deemed necessary to meet the requirements of EU Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway). The scope might well consist of a staggered two- (or multi-) fold approach for example:Solution A: desired solution with desired capability and clearly defined IOC/FOC; required to have maximum life cycle;Solution B: (interim) solution with less than desired capability and no clearly defined IOC/FOC; required to be supportable and to have a life cycle enabling operations until FOC is reached.Nevertheless the key element of this topic will be to establish the feasibility of the common European requirements for this capability aiming for unity of effort among Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway) in order to create a single platform. This will maximise the cost efficiency of SATOC and also create a basis for interoperability at least among the Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway).Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation):Types of activities(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)	Eligible?(a)	Activities that aim to create underpin and improve knowledge products and technologies including disruptive technologies which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (generating knowledge)	Yes(optional)(b)	Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience including secured production and exchange of data to master critical defence technologies to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (integrating knowledge)	Yes(optional)(c)	Studies such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products technologies processes services and solutions	Yes(mandatory)(d)	Design of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment	Yes(optional)(e)	System prototyping of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(f)	Testing of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(g)	Qualification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(h)	Certification of a defence product tangible or intangible component or technology	No(i)	Development of technologies or assets increasing efficiency across the life cycle of defence products and technologies	NoThe proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of the mandatory activities:Technical studies:analysis of the requirements of the Member States and EDF associated countries (Norway) and its translation into potential solutions;identification of possible solutions – both short- and long-term – (technical modifications on existing solutions or developments of new solutions) or combination of solutions to best meet the desired capability;studies such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or improved technologies products processes services and solutions;pre-design including pre-definition of technical specifications and partial tests for risk reduction;feasibility analysis of each solution or combination of solutions;evaluation of achievable performances and response to operational needs (partially or totally) of each solution or combination of solutions;preliminary life cycle analysis.Operations studies:support the drafting of CONOPS for each proposed solution;Identification of logistic solutions (in-service support).Programme studies:market analysis to quantify demand across European nations and export-potential analysis including civil dual-use applications and accordingly description of the capability.

ATM Excellent science and outreach for air–ground integration and autonomy,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa1-2;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:Operational efficiency: the proposed solutions shall improve operational efficiency thanks to advanced communication means and increased automation. In particular further improvements on vertical flight efficiency and cruising/taxiing fuel consumption are expected;Environment: the proposed solutions shall aim at optimising fuel-burn and the CO2 emissions per flight;Capacity: the integration of new airspace users and air vehicles (unmanned aircraft HLO operations etc.) shall not negatively impact capacity;Cost-efficiency: is expected to be improved thanks to the new services supported by air-ground connectivity;Safety: increased air-ground autonomy will enable the human actors to be discharged from routine tasks and to focus on strategic tasks including safety oversight of the operations;Security: The proposed solutions are expected to identify and mitigate the potential security risks deriving from the increased connectivity between stakeholders.Scope:The Digital European Sky vision foresees the progressive evolution towards autonomous flying increasing the global ATM performance in terms of capacity operational efficiency and accommodation of new and/or more autonomous forms of mobility and air vehicles i.e. supporting the evolving demand in terms of diversity complexity from very low-level airspace to high level operations. The challenge is to propose and develop potential innovative or breakthrough solutions to allow the accommodation or full integration of these air vehicles which will have a high degree of autonomy and will use digital means of communication and navigation. This requires closer integration and advanced means of communication between vehicle and infrastructure capabilities so that the infrastructure can act as a digital twin [A digital twin is a digital representation of an intended or actual real-world physical product system or process (a physical twin) that serves as the effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes such as simulation integration testing monitoring and maintenance] of the aircraft. Future operations should therefore rely on direct interactions between air and ground automation with the human role focused on strategic decision-making while monitoring automation. The objective is to ensure that both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles operate in a seamless and safe environment using common infrastructure and services supporting a common concept of trajectory-based operations.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to meet the challenge described above and achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the air-ground automation and autonomy R & I flagship:New advanced means of communication between vehicle and ground infrastructure capabilities. In the future the aim is to enable a much richer integration of ground infrastructure and air vehicles so that ground information of vehicles operations etc. becomes similar to a digital twin of the traffic and vehicles situation. Future operations rely on direct interactions between air and ground automation with the human role focused on strategic decision-making while monitoring automation support. Research shall address innovative and automated means of air ground communication. Research may address different operating environments e.g. airport en-route TMA. In the airport environment research shall take into consideration EASA Triple 1 research (R&I need: Enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Air-to-air (A/A) communication. The objective of this research element is to address A/A communication to enable new operations and to support advanced separation management and safety nets in the context of the safe cohabitation of different types of air vehicles (e.g. high altitude drones business aviation scheduled aircraft rotorcraft etc.). This includes the definition of potential use cases describing the application of A/A communication potential technical solutions spectrum needs risk assessment of loss of A/A communications etc. A/A communication in the context of ATM/U-space in particular for the safe co-habitation of these diverse aerial vehicles is also in scope (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Air-to-air (A/A) exchange services. Research addresses the definition of air-to-air services for the dissemination and exchange of relevant information (e.g. meteorological weather hazards wake vortices trajectory information between aircraft for operational purposes etc.). Significant weather events such as wake turbulence icing etc. captured by on-board system which may be of safety concern to individual or multiple aircraft could be broadcast to other airspace users. The objective is to increase safety and operational efficiency (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Improved air safety using on-board / ground wake turbulence detection and prediction. Research focuses on how safety could be improved thanks to the use of wake turbulence detection information which could be provided via different means (either air or ground based). This information could improve the pilot situational awareness regarding the surrounding wake turbulence events since he/she will have access to this wake turbulence information through on-board sensors. Regarding the on-board detection the aim is to ensure tactical measurement of wake turbulence activation of flight control response countering wake turbulence impact in order to increase the stability of the aircraft thereby improving safety and capacity. Research may also address ground-based en-route ATC wake turbulence alerting: the ground-based prediction would rely on aircraft trajectory prediction accurate higher altitude wind information (using downlink / Mode-S) and wake turbulence encounter risk model. The technical ground-based en-route wake turbulence encounter risk prediction capabilities need to be assessed from a feasibility and performance perspective. Research aims at confirming the technical capability to predict the risk with sufficient accuracy while limiting the risk of false alarm to an acceptable level thus delivering the expected safety benefits. The on-board based detection has been addressed to some extent in SESAR (PJ.06.08.01/PJ.12.02.02 and PJ.02 in Wave 1) but the concept presented some technical challenges which should be addressed. For the ground-based part work performed in the non-SESAR project SAFEMODE shall be considered (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).,,General conditions1.

ATM Excellent science and outreach for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for aviation,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa1-8;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes.Environment: the proposed solutions shall have a positive impact on the environment (i.e. in terms of emissions noise and/or local air quality) and on the aviation environmental footprint e.g. AI will enable the optimisation of aircraft trajectories;Capacity: AI will play a fundamental role in aviation/ATM to address airspace capacity shortages enabling dynamic configuration of the airspace and allowing dynamic spacing separation between aircraft;Operational efficiency: the proposed solutions are expected to improve the synchronisation and predictability of the ATM system;Cost efficiency: AI will enrich aviation datasets with new types of datasets unlocking air/ground AI-based applications fostering data-sharing and building up an inclusive AI aviation/ATM partnership;Safety: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of safety as the current ATM system;Security: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of security as the current ATM system.Scope:Tomorrow’s aviation infrastructure will be more data-intensive and thanks to the application of Machine Learning (ML) deep learning and big data analytics aviation practitioners will be able to design an ATM system that is smarter and safer by constantly analysing and learning from the ATM ecosystem. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the main enablers to overcome the current limitations in the ATM system. AI is a breakthrough technology that could radically influence or transform the aviation/ATM industry value chain potentially impacting all stakeholders including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their business models. The impact of transformative AI will be felt throughout the industry and beyond. The challenge is to develop potential innovative and breakthrough AI solutions that will help addressing capacity issues in ATM by enabling better use of data leading to more accurate predictions and more sophisticated tools increased productivity and enhancing the use of airspace and airports. Considering the extent of these challenges the proposals shall define and develop potential innovative AI-based solutions that may come up with innovative responses based on non-straightforward correlations of parameters while improving the scalability efficiency and resilience of the system.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to meet the challenge described above and achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the AI for aviation flagship.AI for higher automation. This element covers the development of an AI-powered infrastructure and services (supporting higher levels of automation). In addition the aim is to develop automation of ATM processes in which analysis and prediction are particularly likely to benefit from AI and to develop AI-powered ATM environment requirements infrastructure and common regulation and certification guidelines. This may include the research on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) that has a great potential to enable a highly automated ATM where functions roles and tasks are allocated to human and artificial intelligence-based agents at both ground and airborne side based on the strengths and weaknesses of each type of agent. Research shall take into account the impact on the role of the human responsibility and liability aspects etc. (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Exploring underuse AI paradigm in ATM. AI Paradigms (X-axis) are the approaches used by AI researchers to solve specific AI-related problems. Without trying to be exhaustive a broad classification accounts for: logic-based tools knowledge-based tools probabilistic methods machine learning embodied intelligence search and optimization. Latest projects applications have concentrated most of the research efforts on application of ML in ATM in detriment of exploring the possibilities of what the other paradigms could do for ATM. Research aims at investigating these alternative possibilities (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Transfer-learning and few-shot learning methodologies in ML ad XAI. Research focuses on transfer-learning and few-shot learning methodologies. In ATM domain the transfer-learning methodology could be another essential research and development direction for utilizing machine learning and XAI. The lifelong machine can incorporate transfer learning for parameterizing to learn domain-invariant features (e.g. how existing AI models can be used for solving different tasks that share common features or attributes). Transfer-learning can also be used where there are some relations between ATM tasks such as balancing arrival and departure capacity and take-off delay prediction. Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning framework that enables a pre-trained model to generalize over new categories of data (that the pre-trained model has not seen during training) using only a few labelled samples per class e.g. models for the detection of objects in an image etc. Research on this element shall consider the output of project ARTIMATION (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Innovative methodologies for ATM safety security and resilience. Research aims at developing methodologies (or evolution of existing ones) for safety security and resilience that will contribute to ensure that ATM is robust against ever-evolving risks threats and disruptive events in the physical and cyber worlds in an environment with automation levels 4/5. New and disruptive technologies operations and business models to ensure ATM is resilient against internal and external threats including health natural disasters terrorism and criminal activity. Research shall ensure coordination with EASA (R&I need: trustworthy AI-powered ATM environment).Ensuring the integrity of non-ATM data for AI/ML applications in ATM. For artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in aviation the integrity and quality of input data is critical. The benefits of AI in ATM can only be leveraged if the models are fed with great quantities of good quality data. While existing ATM data present certain homogeneity and is by design oriented to ATM uses and analysis other data sources also needed for the development of AI models in ATM are heterogeneous and not adapted to ATM granularities. One example is meteorological information which is presented in a variety of sources and formats that are not always of direct use in ATM solutions. There is a need to develop potential solutions to identify erroneous data injected from non-ATM sources that could introduce a safety risk in ATM and how to mitigate it. The research shall address these non-ATM data availability and format proposing a framework for data curation sharing and feeding oriented to ATM use cases as well as developing new indicators at least for data quality and integrity (R&I need: Trustworthy AI-powered ATM environment).Enhancing robustness and reliability of machine learning (ML) applications. Research aims at enhancing machine learning (ML) applications to ensure they are technically robust accurate and reproducible and able to deal with and inform about possible failures inaccuracies and errors. Research aims at developing potential solutions to address this challenge which shall include/refer to the EASA methodologies for certification of AI in aviation. The scope may address:Verification methods of robustness for machine learning (ML) applications. Due to the statistical nature of machine learning applications they are subject to variability on their output for small variations on their input (that may even be imperceptible by a human). Research aims at proposing new methods to verify the robustness of machine learning applications as well as to evaluate the completeness of the verification;Standardised methods for evaluation of the operational performance of the machine learning (ML). Research addresses the definition of reference methods and metrics to assess the accuracy or error rate of ML applications;Application of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques for the development of the proposed applications thus guaranteeing their robustness. In addition these systems would be continuously validated using ML Ops methodology and explainability techniques to ensure system performance and detect as early as possible if concept drift is occurring;Identification detection and mitigation means of bias in ML applications. Machine learning applications are subject to bias which can compromise the integrity of their outputs. One of the most challenging aspects when collecting preparing or using data is the capability to identify detect and finally mitigate adequately any bias that could have been introduced at any time during the data management and/or of the training processes. Research aims at developing potential solutions to address this challenge (R&I need: trustworthy AI-powered ATM environment).Accelerating AI implementation for ATC automation. AI implementation pace in ATC is far slow compared to other industries. Safety is the principal barrier in the ATC context. Research aims at developing concrete applications that can support the acceleration of AI implementation in Europe. The research seeks for environments where full (or close to full) ATC automation may become a reality in the short term without human supervision. Those scenarios could be very low complex situations like night shifts where few flights need ATC service are the most suitable but the research should explore the suitability of more complex scenarios. Research also addresses exploratory activities on solutions non-dependant of human supervision to take back control to solve contingency is necessary. Research may propose ML-based potential solutions to address specific operational use cases relying on explainability techniques to validate the robustness and performance of the system in all types of situations(R&I need: Trustworthy AI-powered ATM environment).Just culture and AI. Before the introduction of AI/ML into the ATM system it was difficult but possible to draw the red line between “gross negligence” “wilful violations” and “destructive acts” on the one side and “honest mistakes” on the other side. State of the art algorithms for AI/ML systems such as neural networks are essentially “black boxes” in terms of explainability. Arguably the best-known disadvantage of neural networks is their “black box” nature. Simply put it is unknown how or why the neural network came up with a certain output given a certain input. In other words they are tremendously successful in providing accurate predictions based on historical data but no one can understand why. The introduction of AI/ML in essence clouds the drawing of a red line between “gross negligence” “wilful violations” and “destructive acts” on the one side and “honest mistakes” on the other side. Research aims at redefining just culture and rewrite its procedures in the era of digitalization (R&I need: Trustworthy AI-powered ATM environment).Development of ATM specific ontologies. This research element focuses on special-purpose representation systems (e.g. semantic networks and description logics) that can be devised to help organizing a hierarchy of ATM related categories. There are many variants of semantic networks but all are capable of representing individual objects categories of objects and relations among objects. Knowledge representation through a semantic network will enable ATM-related knowledge to be expressed not only in natural language but also in a format that can be read and used by software agents; hence permitting them to find share and integrate information more easily (R&I need: AI Improved datasets for better airborne operations).,,General conditions1.

ATM Excellent science and outreach for capacity on demand and dynamic airspace,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa1-3;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:Capacity: the proposed solutions are expected to provide a more stable and predictable level of capacity in all-weather operations. In addition by providing capacity dynamically where and when it is needed and re-configuring the airspace to match the traffic flows overall system resilience will be significantly increased;Operational efficiency: the proposed solutions are expected to improve operational efficiency in terms of human performance and the resilience of the staff involved (e.g. ATCOs) to new working methods generated because of new/different task allocation strategies. Trajectory management and dynamic airspace configurations will provide further improvements in vertical flight efficiency;Cost-efficiency: dynamic airspace configurations capacity-on-demand ATCO training programmes will provide scalability. ATCO productivity is expected to increase significantly;Safety: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of safety as the current ATM system.Scope:The future ATM system will require increased agility and flexibility in providing capacity where and when it will be needed across the network particularly for maximising the use and performance of limited resources i.e. airspace and ATCOs. The challenge is to propose innovative potential solutions that will supply the required capacity on demand in a dynamic agile and resilient manner improving cost and flight efficiency while maintaining (or improving) safety. These solutions shall enable the dynamic reconfiguration of resources and the provision of new capacity-on-demand services to maintain safe resilient smooth and efficient air transport operations while allowing for the optimisation of trajectories even at busy periods. The proposed innovative solutions shall aim at responding to emerging business needs that can only be addressed through standardised data sharing between air traffic service providers using a highly interconnected digital and resilient network.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to meet the challenge described above and achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the capacity on demand and dynamic airspace flagship:Increasing the use of middle airspace. This element addresses the potential business case for increasing the use of middle airspace (approximately between 15 000 ft. and 25 000 ft.) by different type of aircraft (jet engine aircraft aircraft with new propulsion systems etc.). Research shall address the environmental impact of providing ATFM slots for flights in middle airspace e.g. fuel consumption emissions etc. and the trade-offs with other KPAs such as increased capacity (and reduced delays) (R&I need: on-demand ATSs).Network performance cockpit for “network minded” decision making. This research element aims at establishing a network performance cockpit for “network minded” decision making including support to enhanced connectivity both for identifying unattended business opportunities and for managing disruptive crises. How to optimize the current computer assisted slot allocation (CASA) algorithm to consider flow interactions and to implement regulations based on traffic flows with the consequent reduction of delay and therefore overall network performance improvement is under scope. In addition these evolutions may include the consideration of actual aircraft performance flight profile preferences by airlines and direct routings given by controllers in the en-route phase of flight. This new approach to set ATFCM regulations will improve the ATFCM network decision-making and will avoid unnecessary and ineffective regulations by considering optimal solutions at regional level. In support of the network performance management research shall propose flow-monitoring dashboards (R&I need: on-demand ATS).Global weather and environment monitoring ATM network. The key objective is to design and start developing a single monitoring and reporting system for a green ATM covering all aviation impacts: greenhouse emissions noise and air pollutants and relevant safety and security threats. This research element addresses the secure integration of multiple data to monitor collect integrate and present weather and environment information to the different stakeholders on the ATM system including: pollution contrails noise weather vehicle status congestion and other safety and security threats such as volcanic eruptions earthquakes tsunamis extreme weather events conflicts etc. The primary source of the data may include a variety of sensors: ground air stratosphere space-based etc.: research covers the challenge to integrate / fuse all this information that may have different granularity rate characteristics etc. Research includes the definition of potential solutions to predict safety and security threats in negatively affecting ATM safety manage risks as they emerge and recover from disruption caused by for example factors such as disease climate change volcanic eruptions and solar storms that affect electronic equipment. While focused on the ATM dimension proposals shall consider potential constraints imposed by other domains as well as collateral impacts of ATM research on other domains (R&I: ATM continuity of service despite disruption).,,General conditions1.

ATM Excellent science and outreach for for U-space and urban air mobility,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa1-4;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes.Environment: the proposed solutions should have no negative impact on the environment (i.e. in terms of emissions noise and/or local air quality) or on the potential improvement of the aviation environmental footprint;Capacity: U-space shall not negatively affect the capacity of the ATM system and will enable additional system capacity by enabling large volumes of unmanned aircraft to access the airspace;Passenger experience: U-space will open the way to new services (delivery inspection security etc.) that will increase the wellbeing of European citizens. Particular attention must however be paid to safeguarding privacy and ensuring social acceptance;Safety: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of safety as the current ATM system;Security: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of security as the current ATM system;Cost-efficiency: the proposed solutions are expected to reduce the operation costs of unmanned aircraft.Scope:The Digital European Sky vision includes the seamless integration of U-space with the ATM system to ensure safe and fair access to airspace for all airspace users including innovative air mobility (IAM[1]) flights departing from airports. The challenge is to define and develop breakthrough solutions that will enable U-space to provide the means to manage safely and efficiently high-density traffic at low altitudes involving heterogeneous vehicles (small unmanned aerial vehicles electric vertical take-off and landing – eVTOLs - and conventional manned aircraft) including operations over populated areas and within controlled airspace. Research aims at developing solutions that will support the seamless integration of U-space with the ATM system to ensure safe and fair access to airspace for all airspace users including UAM flights departing from airports.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to meet the challenge described above and achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the U-space and UAM flagship:U-Space as accelerator of evolution of ATM. This element explores whether U-space can be an accelerator of the ATM innovation life cycle facilitating faster lower-risk adoption of new technologies or approaches (automation artificial intelligence (AI) internet of things (IoT) cloud ML Ops etc.). This could include for example the use of U-space communication solutions for air–ground communications on the airport surface (to free up the very high frequency (VHF) spectrum for use in the air) adaptation of U-space automation concepts to manned aviation (e.g. advanced automation). In terms of the evolution of ATM the aim will be to exploit the potential use of U-space technologies and concepts for manned aviation with a focus on exploring the potential applicability of advanced U-space services to uncontrolled airspace in particular Class G airspace. Applications to higher airspace operations (HAOs) are also within the scope of this element (R&I need: transfer of U-space automation technology to ATM).Integrated CONOPS U-space / ATM (R&I need: enable UAM). The research shall focus on:The development of an integrated U-space / ATM CONOPS;The evolution of CORUS CONOPS on U-space towards version 5.0 (research shall take into consideration the output of project CORUS-XUAM);Provide a full U-space / IAM[1] roadmap from ER to deployment and elaboration of key pending R&D needs to be addressed in the different pillars of the R&I pipeline.Urban airspace evolution. The largest concentration of drones is expected over populated areas but these will not be drone-only areas: manned flights will still need to operate like they do today (e.g. security forces emergency services etc.); many of the manned missions over urban areas require flexibility loitering etc. and are often of high priority. The future scenarios will combine manned aircraft and small drones in the same mission (e.g. events emergency management etc.). In addition people-carrying eVTOLs initially with an on-board or remote pilot and in the future autonomous will also be introduced in the urban airspace. In the current environment manned flights over urban areas are typically operated under VFR or special VFR rules; this set-up provides the flexibility required by their typical mission profiles but if unchanged would be very limiting towards drone-manned aviation airspace sharing. The objective of the research is to investigate potential solutions to introduce drones in the urban environment while still allowing flexibility for manned aircraft and drones as required by the typical urban mission profiles. Solutions may include digital flight rules (to be developed) and/or the dynamic creation of corridors/reserved areas when required by the mission with the definition of containment requirements. It is expected the research to address in particular the concept of 2D containment for VFR aircraft considering the applicability of RNP-like navigation specifications for VFR aircraft or the development of specific navigation requirements for VFR aircraft that potentially combine visual references with on-board instrument support. The research should aim at developing a scalable concept and deepen into its applicability at a small scale (a few drones and manned aircraft flying typical missions in the same area representative of the initial demand). The research may cover related urban-specific technical issues such as inter-alia C2 performance GNSS performance and the potential areas with a microclimate that are often found in heavily built-up areas. Proposals should provide evidence that the applicants are familiar with the existing literature (e.g. previous SESAR research in this area in particular PJ.34 project AURA research on ATM/U-space integration previous SESAR U-space demonstrations etc.) and existing standards (e.g. PBN/RNP) and describe how their proposed work would address the outstanding research challenges (R&I need: enable UAM).Cooperative operations between drones. This research element explores operations where several drones need to operate cooperatively such as drone swarming formation flying etc. that could involve the coordination of several flight plans as well as their dynamic evolution. One example is the in-flight battery replacement (including fast charging) for electrical drones. Electrical aircraft may be the alternative for the aviation in a future where a key objective is to reduce emissions and noise. Batteries for aeronautical propulsion must evolve to accomplish with low weight spatial restrictions safety reliability and environmental protection requirements. However the low specific energy of batteries compared to the energy density of kerosene means reduced time and distance flown before the electric batteries run out and need to be replaced. In-flight battery replacement has been proposed as a way to address this limitation. Research can model the flight missions with in-flight battery replacement and investigate the U-space concepts that might be needed to support these operations. The research covers the integration of these missions in the U-space ecosystem. Drone design and battery design are outside of scope; projects shall use drones/drone models developed prior to the start of the project; however the development of U-space systems and the integration of new drone models/drone mission models into the U-space systems or simulators are in scope (R&I need: develop advanced U-space services).Improving risk modelling in U-space. Research activities shall develop more accurate air-risk and ground-risk models (e.g. more accurate estimation of the severity of an aircraft crashing on the ground due either to a direct impact or to a mid-air collision) to better understand the link between the TLS and the subsequent impact e.g. frequency of fatalities economic impact reputational impact etc. The scope may include the link to potential models for insurance policies. Research should consider different scenarios and variables (e.g. variable demand etc.) and take into account also vertiports and particularly vertiports with more than one FATO and frequent operations. Research shall apply SORA methodology (R&I need: U-space safety assurance).Integration of air vehicles and personal air vehicles. In the future new unmanned aircraft systems and personal air vehicles will fly long range and at higher altitudes to feed airports. This research will investigate the necessary seamless integration of those personal air vehicles into a more automated ATM (R&I need: ATM/U-space integration).ATM/U-Space/UAM performance interdependency and trade-offs. U-Space services may have an impact in ATM performance results presenting the need to explore potential trade-offs between different key performance areas / indicators. Research shall explore the interdependencies between the ATM and U-space/UAM performance framework analyse interdependencies between these environments and potential trade-offs to facilitate the deployment of U-space/UAM new services (R&I need: ATM/U-space integration).Multi-domain scenario generation service for U-space. Research aims at developing a multi-domain what-if scenario generation service (air land surface cybersecurity) capable of consuming and testing the services exposed from the flight plan management and drone fleet control platforms and being able to generate different load situations emergencies or simulation of different scenarios in real time such as:The registration of fleets drones users and consumption of all services enabled for this purpose;The whole process of requesting flight plans with different cases in order to validate the platform in all the allowed use cases;Simulation and generation of different scenarios of thousands of drones in operation that consume in real time the position and the intersection services between drones and geofences for the drones control platform;Generation of what-if scenarios where drones perform anomalous behaviours e.g. navigate outside the authorized corridor in the flight plan enter in forbidden geofence generate UAS with risk of collision with other drones etc.;Creation of different emergency situations affecting drones with authorized flight plans both before starting the flight and during the flight so that the systems and communication services and the warning and flight plans modification services are exposed to stress tests for the involved flees and scenarios in order to stress the control systems and services in real time.(R&I need: Support the development of the U-space regulatory framework and required standards).[1]As per the EU Drone Strategy 2.0 IAM includes UAM Regional Air Mobility and International Air Mobility.[2]As per the EU Drone Strategy 2.0 IAM includes UAM Regional Air Mobility and International Air Mobility.,,General conditions1.

ATM application-oriented research for air–ground integration and autonomy,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa2-2;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes.Capacity: the integration of new airspace users and air vehicles (unmanned aircraft systems HLO operations etc.) shall not negatively impact capacity;Cost-efficiency: thanks to the new services supported by air–ground and air-air connectivity cost-efficiency is expected to be improved;Operational efficiency: the proposed solutions are expected to contribute to the improvement of the operational efficiency thanks to advanced communication means and increased automation (e.g. machine-to-machine communication). In addition further automation will improve trajectory management in particular vertical flight efficiency;Environment: the proposed solutions shall aim at optimising fuel-burn and the CO2 emissions per flight;Safety: increased air-ground autonomy will enable the human actors to be discharged from routine tasks and to focus on strategic tasks including safety oversight of the operations;Security: The proposed solutions are expected to identify and mitigate the potential security risks deriving from the increased connectivity between stakeholders.Scope:The challenge is to design and develop concrete innovative applications (that are already TRL1 achieved within SESAR programme or outside) that aim at increasing the level of air-ground integration supported by high automation levels and that will enable the transition to trajectory based operations (TBO). The proposed solutions will aim at realising the Digital European Sky vision that foresees the full integration of an increasing number of new forms of mobility and air vehicles which have a high degree of autonomy and use digital means of communication and navigation. The proposed solutions shall support the evolution towards the future ATM system exploiting existing technologies as much as possible and developing new ones in order to increase global ATM performance in terms of capacity operational efficiency and accommodation of new and/or more autonomous air vehicles i.e. supporting the evolving demand in terms of diversity complexity from very low-level airspace to high-level operations. The challenge is to ensure the full integration of certified drones into all classes of airspace full U-space services and single pilot operations thanks to increased automation and delegation of separation responsibility to systems.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they have already successfully achieved TRL1 (within SESAR programme or outside) and include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the air–ground integration and autonomy flagship.Frequency switching management. This research will investigate from a gate-to-gate perspective the automation of air–ground coordination to ensure the use of automatic voice and datalink frequency selection for communications by the pilot and ATC. The scope of automatic frequency selection covers an assessment of multilink schemes such as policy-based routing (including criteria for selection of terrestrial or satellite bearer and best frequency based on prevailing airspace and service requirements). This is expected also to support enhanced crew resource management single-pilot and cross-border operations (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Advanced air–ground integration for general aviation. This activity will ensure that access to all airspace classes remains open to general aviation in an equitable manner and at an affordable cost as well as the leverage on-board technologies (potentially not certified) in order to guarantee better and safer flights for all general aviation users including sports aviation. It may also include the development of a concept enabling VFR aircraft to share their intended plans in real time with ATC and/or U-space service providers through a low-cost non-certified EPP-like concept based on whatever application the general aviation pilot is using to plan his/her flight in real time. This solution would complement surveillance information and would result in a continually updated flight plan which could be used to automatically change the destination airport to ensure that general aviation pilots receive updated information if their plan changes and to support search and rescue operations when no surveillance information is available. VFR pilots would retain at all times the same degree of flexibility in changing the plan as they have today. Research shall develop applications beyond the state of the art (e.g. existing apps for GA like Safesky) (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Clear air turbulence data presentation to ATC. According to IATA turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to airline passengers and crews globally. Flight crews routinely report clear air turbulence to controllers who workload permitting relay turbulence reports with aircraft that will be overflying the same area. However controllers often are not able to properly relay this information. Turbulence information is also relevant for controllers e.g. because it can support proactive management of level change requests. Research can propose potential solutions for sharing turbulence reports to controllers addressing how the information will be presented to ATCOs and how they would use it. Proposals should focus on improvement of the clear air turbulence prediction processes (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Evolution of controller/pilot communication. In today’s environment each en-route or TMA sector requires a dedicated VHF frequency for controllers and pilots to communicate over which means the lack of availability of VHF spectrum in areas with a high density of air traffic can make it impossible to increase ATC capacity by adding additional sectors. However the share of controller-pilot communications over datalink vs. those conducted over voice is expected to increase rapidly over the coming years. As voice communications become less and less frequent it will be impractical to require a single VHF frequency to be reserved for the exclusive use of the controller-pilot communications within a sector. Instead the SESAR long-term concept is that voice will be transmitted via the same channel as datalink i.e. move to digital voice. The new concept also allows for an evolution of the voice communications concept. For example in digital voice the transmissions for change of frequency and checking into a sector would not be necessary anymore. Instead the handover from one controller to the next will be linked to the handover of the CPDLC communications and be completely transparent to the flight crew i.e. whenever the pilot makes a voice transmission the communication would be routed to the controller in charge of the flight. Digital voice will also make it possible to configure voice communications as broadcast or point to point depending on the environment. Where broadcast is not in use an access indicator might be implemented to indicate to the flight crew the voice channel is busy (without transmitting the content of the ongoing communication) to avoid simultaneous transmissions over the same channel. There is a need to further investigate how the dynamic allocation of IP connections may reduce the need for VHF channels on the ground side and the need for the airborne side to switch frequencies several times during the flight. In SESAR the technical feasibility and performance of the digital voice concept has been researched by solution PJ.33-W3-02 in SESAR considering LDACS as the underlying technology. The objective of this element is to further develop the operational concept and make a holistic analysis of the potential for the concept to be supported by alternative datalink technologies e.g. Satcom commercial links satellite-based VHF etc. (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Air and ground synchronisation applications. AI-powered systems are expected to be integrated into ground and cockpit systems enhancing communication for trajectory management and much more. The scope of this research includes the identification of innovative applications / AI-based solutions that could improve such synchronisation. Research aims at performing a risk assessment on loss of air-ground communications and determining continuity integrity and performance requirements on air-ground communications for the proposed applications (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Controller support systems for improved radio communication and inclusion of automation. Several radio communications require the controller to bear a significant workload be it for a negotiation process with pilots or repetition of routine messages the coordination with datalink communication and the induced task of simultaneous input into a dedicated information system. The multiple remote tower use case is for example in need of a solution to address the specific problem of multiple frequencies management in a safe and easy way. Assistance either automated or reducing time and workload for input or radio frequency management at large would therefore be beneficial. Research aims at developing a proof of concept for an enhanced system to assist radio management. This would relieve the controller from the active execution of input ease message identify potential errors and eventually enable automatic treatment of requests or communication (R&I need: enabling greater ground and airborne integration and wider performance).Integration of super-high-altitude operating aerial vehicle. These vehicles which can be viewed as drones will also need to be integrated with entry and exit procedures through segregated or non- segregated airspace. As a result new airspace users include highly autonomous vehicles. Safe separation management of this traffic and efficient integration into the traditional ATM operation is both a technical and operational challenge. By 2035 daily high-level operations (HLO) are expected and their transition from a segregated and/or non-segregated airspace have to be well established with appropriate regulations (with EASA involvement) clear technological capabilities and suitable performances for such air platforms. The research could also benefit from research on the physics of the atmosphere for such HLO based on the existing state of the art. Research should consider the relevant human factor issues (R&I need: super-high-altitude operating aerial vehicles).Single pilot operations (SPO). Research aims at addressing the following aspects:Safety systems and crew health and HP monitoring systems for supporting SPO. In order to operate safely with a reduced crew safety systems and crew health monitoring systems will be a key enabler to trigger the back-up modes in case of incapacitation stress or exhaustion of crew members. This is of paramount importance in order to be able to recognise possible dangerous situations forgotten steps of procedures or checklists inappropriate or non-executed actions by the pilot.Incapacitation detection in SPO. Development of a highly reliable automated incapacitation detection system. Research addresses the challenges derived of a possible failure of the incapacitation detection system false positives and how to address partial incapacitation or drift towards incapacitation. The transfer of authority can fall into a grey area between the air and ground pilots for a relevant period: crew resource management (CRM) procedures and guidelines for this new distributed crew should be developed and evaluated. The analysis of the transition period from nominal SPO case (on-board pilot in control) and incapacitation confirmation is as well under the scope.This research addresses also the expected role of FOC/WOC in the case of SPO abnormal situations: it requires their connection to ATC centres to support safe return to land even in a congested traffic environment. Research should consider the relevant human factor issues. Research shall consider the output of project SAFELAND (R&I need: Single-pilot operations (SPO)).Machine-to-machine communication. In addition to human-to-human communication such as controller–pilot datalink communications (CPDLC) datalink will also support machine-to-machine communication. This covers for example a machine-to-machine negotiation-based conflict resolution. The development of mechanisms and tools for creating negotiation-based resolutions at conflict resolution and collision avoidance levels (e.g. what-if extended projected profile (EPP)-based tools or ATC offering a choice to the FMS of two potential cruising levels) will be addressed. This is a flight deck to ATC solution (i.e. with airline operations centre involvement). Technical and operational requirements as well as use cases and initial validation will be addressed in this research (R&I need: integrated 4D trajectory automation in support of TBOs).FMS-twin for enhanced A/G connectivity. The SESAR-developed availability of the flight management system (FMS) trajectory on the ATM ground systems via the EPP downlink has represented a breakthrough in ATM. This capability provides visibility to ATM systems of what is loaded in the FMS thereby enabling a multitude of advanced applications on the ground. It is envisaged that additional applications can be developed if the ground ATM system also have availability of what-if FMS trajectories which make it possible for ATM to anticipate how the trajectory would change under certain hypotheses. The hypothetical trajectory revision to be considered could be proposed by the ATM system be proposed by the flight crew (potentially associated to a request for a clearance) or be automatically generated (to inform the ATM system of the way the FMS would implement different potential clearances that are relevant to the current context). However development of additional applications for the FMS is slow and complex due to the safety criticality associated to the FMS flight-path control capabilities; for the same reason once an FMS feature is developed there is little flexibility for its evolution. A potential way through might be the development of an FMS-twin software to be installed in an on-board embedded computer without flight-path control capabilities in an Electronic Flight Bag without flight-path control capabilities or in the FOC (on the ground). If located on board the aircraft the FMS-twin should be able to exchange information with both ATM and the FOC through non-certified A/G links. The FMS-twin is expected to be a decision support tool enabling the A/G exchanges during the execution phase for both A/G FF-ICE/R2 negotiations for the update of the trajectory during the execution phase beyond the horizon of interest of ATC and A/G exchanges in support of the ATC TBO concepts. The research would explore the challenges of the FMS-twin concept define a first set of candidate applications and perform an initial evaluation of potential benefits. Research shall take into consideration the potential applications to meet the needs of solution PJ.01-W2-08A2 and/or solution PJ.07-W2-38 (R&I need: Integrated 4D trajectory automation in support of trajectory-based operations (TBO)).Advanced aircraft on-board systems. Research aims at developing potential ATM applications such as: tools for monitoring flight crew workload support to 4D navigation (applied to all types of flight from low altitude to sub-orbital) increased situational awareness self-separation of traffic traffic prediction collision alerting and avoidance all weather approach and landing and automatic flight control . Research also addresses pilot support systems for automatic route negotiation with ATCOs. A route change request requires the pilot to sustain a negotiation process with ATCOs over a shared radio channel while performing its duty. Industry is developing tools for supporting the pilot during this process that however are very limited in terms of automation and as a result require still active execution of the task by the pilot. Research aims at developing a proof of concept of an automatic system for reliving the pilot from the active negotiation by delegating that to an automated system (R&I need: integrated 4D trajectory automation in support of TBOs).,,General conditions1.

ATM application-oriented research for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for aviation,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-sesar-2023-des-er2-wa2-4;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Open for submission,29 June 2023,15 November 2023 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes.Environment: the proposed solutions are expected to demonstrate the positive impact of AI-based solutions on operational mitigation of aviation’s environmental impact.Capacity: the proposed solutions are expected to contribute to capacity by addressing AI-based human operator support tools to for example ensure the integration of new entrant aircraft types.Operational efficiency: the proposed solutions are expected to improve the operational efficiency by enabling better traffic predictions and forecasts thus contributing to punctuality.Safety: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of safety as the current ATM system.Security: the proposed solutions are expected to maintain at least the same level of security as the current ATM system.Scope:The challenge is to design and develop concrete innovative AI applications (that are already TRL1 achieved within SESAR programme or outside) that aim at:Enabling better use of data leading to more accurate predictions and more sophisticated tools (e.g. new conflict detection traffic advisory and resolution tools) increased productivity and enhancing the use of airspace and airport;Enriching aviation datasets with new types of datasets unlocking air/ground AI-based applications fostering data-sharing and building up an inclusive AI aviation/ATM partnership to better support decision-makers pilots air traffic controllers and other stakeholders;Supporting (i.e. AI assistants) all ATM actors from planning to operations and across all airspace users;Enabling the virtualisation of infrastructure and air traffic service provision in all types of airspace ranging from very low to high altitude operations. In doing so AI will enable the system to become more modular and agile while building resilience to disruption traffic growth and greater airspace user diversity;Developing new ATM/U-space services.The SESAR 3 JU has identified the following innovative research elements that could be used to achieve the expected outcomes. The list is not intended to be prescriptive; proposals for work on areas other than those listed below are welcome provided they have already successfully achieved TRL1 (within SESAR programme or outside) and include adequate background and justification to ensure clear traceability with the R&I needs set out in the SRIA for the AI for aviation flagship.Innovative methodologies for quantifying the impact on safety and resilient performance of higher automation in ATM. This research aims at developing new methodologies for quantifying the impact on safety and resilient performance of higher automation in the ATM system applying data-driven techniques. These methodologies shall provide additional tools for the ATM stakeholders for evaluating and quantifying the impact of higher automation (e.g. AI/ML-based SESAR solutions) and could be potentially used for in-depth verification of safety criteria associated to a given SESAR solution in early R&I stages but also to evaluate the state of the current system. Research shall built on the work performed by project FARO on en-route environment and automation levels 2/3 but it shall extend to other operating environments and to higher automation levels (4/5) (R&I need: trustworthy AI powered ATM environment).Safety filter for AI solution. Study safety filter concept for data prediction responsible for deciding on the usability of the ML model predicted data. Safety filter works as a safeguard without human intervention and qualifies the predicted sensor-data as valid or invalid by applying captured expertise rules. Research may address the application of dynamic risk assessment (DRA) and business impact assessment (BIA) techniques to distribute and enrich the exchange of information with federated learning architectures (R&I need: cyber-resilience). Research shall take into account the output of project SINAPSE.Artificial situational awareness: This research aims at developing artificial situational awareness solutions based on high-integrity information that are able to describe the traffic situation on a sector (en-route / TMA) or airport and integrated with machine-learning (ML) enable the assessment of probabilistic events (e.g. trajectory prediction or conflict detection). By combining reasoning engine with machine learning the proposed solutions shall be able to assess complex interactions between objects draw conclusions explain the reasoning behind those conclusions and predict future system states. The objective is to develop AI-based systems that can assist ATCOs with monitoring tasks and contribute to the team situation awareness (SA): a situationally aware system would share the ATCOs’ SA since it would have access to the same data as an ATCO. Research may:Assess how ML module predictions could use the optimization of their anticipation spans as they differ from ATCOs;Analyse how automation and adaptation to novel system changes ATCOs’ learning success;Investigate whether certain information could pertain to shift supervisors Network Managers ATSEP and FMPs;Explore the possibility of flexible machine/machine coordination between sectors or units;Develop an HMI that will allow the ATCOs to review information inform ATCOs with the right timing be able to recognise when certain information is necessary in order to avoid ATCOs attention dissipating on less important information and additional memory load recognise when an ATCO SA is degraded and provide the necessary alerts at an appropriate time etc.;Develop scenario simulators so that through probabilistic models future scenarios can be predicted;Validate benefits in terms of safety (e.g. by introducing an additional safety net performing tedious monitoring tasks with high reliability) interoperability between different systems (e.g. by enhancing data handling) and capacity (e.g. by automating some of the monitoring tasks and enabling the introduction of other automation systems).Research shall take into account the output of project AISA (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): since the decisions provided by AI/ML algorithms are often opaque non-intuitive and not understandable by human operators this represents a limitation to their applicability in ATM. The objective of this research is to improve transparency of automated systems in the ATM domain investigating methods based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in operational use cases e.g. predicting air traffic conflict resolution and delay propagation validating the robustness and transparency of the system etc. Research shall take into account the output of project ARTIMATION (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).AI-powered co-piloting. Research aims at investigating how AI can support pilots in complex and critical situations when workload may be high and/or the time to react very limited. For these situations research should focus for example on how to exploit high levels of automation to perform non-critical tasks for pilots and how the HMI should work during such operations so the pilot can focus on essential tasks e.g. during taxi-out descend approach and landing. These applications may play a significant role in the transition to single pilot operations. In addition AI-powered applications could support the pilot in situations where workload is low e.g. engaging pilot’s attention and alert the pilot in case something unexpected happens. Research may address the development of algorithms based on reinforcement learning to help the pilot make decisions. The research results should demonstrate how the technology could support pilots in carrying out their tasks (e.g. demonstrate an increase in human capabilities during the execution of complex scenarios or a reduction in human workload in the execution of standard tasks) and assess the impact on the role of the human (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).AI for complex operations. This research is about developing AI-based human operator support tools to ensure the safe integration of new entrant aircraft types into an increasingly busy heterogeneous and complex traffic mix (i.e. unmanned aircraft systems supersonic aircraft hybrid and fully electric aircraft). Algorithms for decision-making based on neural networks and classical optimization techniques could be addressed. Research may also consider the use of more advanced techniques such as reinforcement learning. Research should also cover the wider implications for other organisations and the impact on the network (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).User interface providing conflict resolution advisory transparency. This research focuses on visual elements that allow better understanding why a particular conflict resolution solution is recommended. The visual elements increase the transparency of advisories by providing the operator an insight into the deeper structure of the work domain as well as the inner workings of the AI agent. Research may address:The potential benefits of advisory transparency on advisory acceptance and system trust in relation to ecological approaches AI interpretability models and the connection between the two. Previous research on this field suggests that transparency alone may not be suitable as a measure for increasing operators’ acceptance of advisories and trust in a system when that system performs different from the individual;Transparency mechanisms for supporting the ATCOs in understand how the system works (e.g. the data processing filtering constraints etc. in the model) how it derived a specific advisory (relationships between input data and output) and why the proposed advisory is considered best (e.g. best match to the individual group or optimized according to reinforcement learning (RL) model).Research shall take into account the output of project MAHALO (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Guidelines for the design of future AI systems. This research relates to the application of EASA guidelines to the development of AI enabled systems in ATM. Research shall also contribute to the update of EASA guidelines including feedback on the effects of conformance transparency and complexity and other challenges associated to the design of future AI systems (e.g. trade-offs between privacy and transparency). Research may consider human-in-the-loop simulations considering controller trust acceptance workload and human/machine performance but also new approaches for validation verification and testing of AI applications specifically for safety critical applications e.g. developing an agile validation methodology data centric security capabilities for AI systems to promote reliability increase trust and maintain a competitive edge in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape. Close coordination with EASA is expected to ensure complementarity and consistency with EASA activities on the following areas:Trustworthiness: capability to keep input and output privacy with relatively high cyber-security protection. Support the definition of the requirements and needs for input/output verification (related to trustworthiness in the framework of Structured Transparency) in the ATM context in support of the EASA certification process descriptions. Validate and further develop requirements and potential solutions with a co-joint analysis together with EASA and other operational experts. Clarify some of the challenges faced by EASA e.g. to define the system requirements processes and tools that are needed to perform the validation and certification process.Learning Assurance: including the consideration of realistic operational cases in realistic operational conditions and new ML techniques. Need to develop specific assurance methodologies to deal with learning processes;AI explainability which goes beyond the ML techniques to extract information from the models and includes the interactions with other systems and with the human operators (human factors). Research may help to clarify which requirements and processes the target AI/ML system should comply with in order to be certifiable for operations;AI Safety case: discussing with EASA and other safety experts about the needs and requirements of a concrete safety-case can help to clarify and support the development the EASA guidelines for certification.The concept of safety critical levels need to be further developed for AI applications in ATM. Research covers the definition and analysis of safety-related use cases for different safety level assurances. These safety levels may imply either the adaptation of current SW verification methods or the development of new ones to guarantee the safe of operation of AI in ATM. Research shall take into account the output of projects MAHALO AICHAIN (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Support to the certification of novel ATM-related AI/ML-based airborne and ground systems that enable higher levels of automation. The objective of this research element is to address issues related to the certification of novel ATM-related airborne and ground systems that enable higher levels of automation. Research will address solutions methods etc. that could support and simplify the certification process of innovative systems based on machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. It is expected that proposals define a holistic approach to address this challenge considering not only technical aspects of the certification but also legal and regulatory aspects including privacy. Research may explore and assess potential approaches that could be applied for the certification of automation and that allow to demonstrate the safety of automation during nominal and non-nominal conditions. Of particular interest is to show how safety can be ensured even if not all situations and variations of parameters can be anticipated during the design phase. Proposals may apply uncertainty quantification to address this issue. Research may also address the specific challenges of certification of automation that can adapt its behaviour to changes of the environment over time. Research activities shall take into account other initiatives developing safety of life systems that may have different approaches to certification and review their applicability to ATM (e.g. EGNOS) (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Development of framework to achieve effective Human-AI Teaming. As AI is developed to provide more intelligent behaviours it is argued that there will be an increased need for AI systems to function effectively as team members with humans. Just as human-only teams have many advantages over solo workers (e.g. to manage workload fluctuations provision of a diverse set of skills and capabilities toward the completion of common goals) human-AI teams can have similar benefits over human-only teams. When considering an AI system as a part of a team rather than simply a tool capable of limited actions the need for a framework for improving the design of AI systems to enhance the overall success of human-AI teams becomes apparent. A failure to consider the needs of the many air traffic controllers pilots flight dispatchers flow managers etc. who are responsible for successful ATM operations will result in AI technologies that eventually fail to provide the necessary high levels of performance and may instead cause inefficiencies and safety problems. The design of AI systems for human-AI teams needs to incorporate several highly interrelated considerations. These include designing the AI system to support not only task work but also teamwork. These interrelated considerations include considerations about human-AI team performance and processes team trust team biases team situational awareness team training needs human-AI interaction methods interface transparency and explainability and Human-System Integration processes measures and testing (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Extended reality (XR) in support of ATM operations. The term eXtended Reality (XR) is includes technologies that enhance or replace our view of the world: encompasses augmented reality (AR) virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). Virtual reality guides the observer out of his/her actual environment and into an artificial one. Research aims at using virtual reality to improve the efficiency of ATM operations. Augmented reality enhances certain objects through transparent lenses in the observers’ field of vision. MR sits somewhere between AR and VR as it merges the real and virtual worlds. An evident area of interest is training be it training of maintenance personnel or ATCO/pilot training. ATCO virtual training goes beyond the execution of remote simulations or validations as the ATCO would be physically located anywhere since the simulator HMI is created with extended reality equipment such as glasses and/or haptic devices. The research would investigate the operational and technical feasibility of training individually or collectively with other ATCOs as if they were executing remote simulations or validations through connection with remote real simulators. Research includes how ATCO performance data could be collected in real time to monitor training progress. Artificial intelligence could support the monitoring and detect when the ATCO has acquired the corresponding competence or the ATCO needs to emphasize training in particular aspects. Pseudo piloting as well as the representation of adjacent sectors could be also based on speech recognition making the pilots and adjacent controllers also virtual. However the scope under research is not only limited to training but could also address specific operational challenges in different environments e.g. airport TMA en-route supported by XR techniques:Collaborative environment with multiple users that have the ability to interact with the rest;Applications to access to all relevant information in real time for efficiently and safely managing operations;Digital assistants to support decision-making etc.);Location of tactical elements of operation in the field of vision obtained through advanced communication protocols: pilots ATCO maintenance etc.;Display of indications messages status of own elements alerts or information of interest;Intelligent adaptation of the displayed content according to the operating environment;Gestural or voice interaction (synthesizer and voice command);Situational awareness of the state of operations through AI.The proposal shall show a thorough knowledge of past SESAR activities on this field i.e. ER RETINA and solution PJ.05-W2-97.1 (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).AI based human-machine collaboration to anticipate and respond to human needs by understanding ATCO’s intent and goals. Research aims at developing potential AI based solutions able to understand the traffic situation and in combination with ATCO attention tracking technologies to infer ATCO’s intent. The proposed solutions will support the ATCO not only by performing tasks he/she already intends to perform but also by autonomously performing a task that is outside of the current scope of ATCO’s attention. ATCOs could then set the desired level of supporting actions performed by the AI team member (adaptive automation) and still maintain situational awareness by performing their usual tasks. Research may evaluate the potential use of graph-based models and joint neural networks to help the ATCO better understanding the traffic situation. Research shall address the impact on the role of the human (R&I need: human–AI collaboration: digital assistants).Integrated platforms for the nowcasting and forecasting of multiple meteorological hazards. This research aims at developing of integrated platforms to incorporate predictions of atmospheric hazards (e.g. SO2 contaminants severe weather situations such as deep convection and extreme weather and climate hotspots potentially contributing to global warming etc.). The focus is to enhance the situational awareness of all stakeholders in case of multiple hazard crisis by facilitating the transfer of required relevant information to end-users presenting such information in a user-friendly manner to ATM stakeholders ultimately anticipating severe hazards and fostering better decision-making. Research may address:Extension of nowcasting models of SO2 in 1D (values for a given location) to 2D (lat-long) and 3D and nowcasting products for dust ash volcanic aerosol and precursors and smoke;The consideration of additional observations (e.g. radar satellite sensors on board the aircraft) to better characterize the weather extremes and enhance the quality of the extreme weather nowcasting;The integration of space weather and climate change in the new MET services;The application of artificial intelligence or deep learning models based on recurrent networks could be used to better predict weather phenomena;Address potential air traffic controller decision support systems able to import and process the meteorological forecasts and to adapt tactical arrival and departure scheduling to changing extreme weather conditions;Target airport TMA and en-route operating environments and the potential use by different stakeholders (e.g. Network Manager ANSPs (flow management positions and air traffic controllers) airports airlines (dispatchers and pilots) etc.);Address the assessment of potential benefits in terms of capacity efficiency safety predictability and resilience.Research shall take into account the output of project ALARM (R&I need: AI Improved datasets for better airborne operations).Standardised testbed platform for developing testing and benchmarking AI-applications in ATM. Research in artificial intelligence in ATM has been traditionally fragmented in the area due to the lack of standardised testbeds. The development of a testbed to be adopted as a common framework for future research in applied AI in ATM will enable reproducibility and considering open science practices. Research covers the definition and publication of a library of use cases including input and output data associated to persistent identifiers (such as digital object identifier (DOI)). This will ensure findability and a wider adoption within the ATM research community (R&I need: AI Improved datasets for better airborne operations).,,General conditions1.

As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe’s autonomy particularly in periods of geopolitical instability exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment electric and autonomous vehicles manufacturing and production plants and equipment telecom networks aerospace vehicles consumer productsR&I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality (“Internet of Senses”). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.Despite a strong European scientific community’s on AI and robotics Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing healthcare transport agriculture energy construction) providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.While Europe is strong in many sectors it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness prosperity and sustainability by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches use of biological elements as part of technology and sustainable smart materials. In particular the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118) in particular its ‘secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures’ pillar actions under this Destination will support Europe’s open strategic autonomy and reinforce and regain European industry’s leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain from low-power components to advanced systems future networks new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs values and expectations of society in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.As a result this Destination is structured into the following headings which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:European Innovation Leadership in PhotonicsThe European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘Photonics’.AI Data and RoboticsEurope has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research Europe’s scientific community is leading in AI and robotics but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies only capture 10% of full potential use and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis many AI Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore there is room for improved adoption by industry which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&I from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries from manufacturing to healthcare public sector utilities retail finance insurance transport agriculture energy telecommunications environmental monitoring construction media creative and cultural industries fashion tourism etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘AI Data and Robotics’.When it comes to Robotics Europe is leading in its industry with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics’ cognition safety manipulation soft robotics underwater and aerial robotics with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming fisheries horticulture etc. as well as produce processing ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]] forestry inspection and maintenance logistics construction manufacturing etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial marine ground in-vivo and space).The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics leading the way in research development and deployment of world-class technologies.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘AI Data and Robotics’.Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital AutonomyThe European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe’s global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).In the light of dominant players bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing Cloud Computing edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy – notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.European leadership in Emerging and Enabling TechnologiesEurope’s leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech though this intertwining is essential.The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe’s future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm ShiftSince 2018 the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe’s scientific leadership and excellence in quantum in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU’s aims for quantum R&I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship’s Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators[[Link to provide later]] which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing quantum simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing simulation sensing and communication in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership capitalising on Europe’s established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.The aim of the Commission’s Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used among others for sensitive applications in the area of security and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context the EU must take action to build on its strengths and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets interests autonomy and security while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025 with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact with applications in medicine manufacturing or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography finance and many other sensitive domains.Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU’s interests as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications sensors for autonomous vehicles and the next generation of medical sensors.It is therefore clearly in the EU’s interests to protect European research in these domains the intellectual property that it generates and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe’s strategic dependencies). With this in mind the Commission has decided that in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation communication and sensing only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.Graphene: Europe in the leadThe starting point is the Graphene Flagship launched in 2013 which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation automotive electronics batteries healthcare).The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing experimentation demonstration and support for take-up using the capacities infrastructures and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Europe’s open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI data robotics quantum computing and graphene and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain from low-power components to advanced systems future networks new data technologies and platforms.Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

This next step functionality should clearly delineate from state of the art solutions and can be illustrated by the following non-exhaustive examples that illustrate different types of functional ability. Proposals should address functional challenges that are of equivalent or greater complexity and/or combine different types of functions to deliver greater functional complexity:To reach the point where the robot systems operating in harsh complex and dynamic working environments can carry out sequences of complex functions to achieve a functional goal.For example a robot able to carry out a range of different types of functions where the choice and sequence of execution depends on the dynamics of the operating context as the task progresses.In navigation to reliably and purposefully move between destinations within complex people centric environments that are occupied such as busy transport hubs shopping malls or entertainment and sporting venues; or to move purposefully maintaining a direction of travel towards a target destination or sequence of destinations over variable terrain where the surface is shifting and reactive to the robot’s motion for example on sand gravel or waterlogged ground; or to be able to navigate move purposefully and transition between water and air or water and land including mixed surfaces attaining a target destination or sequence of destinations over extended distances beyond the current state of the art.In manipulation to reach human speed with equivalent dexterity or manipulate objects beyond human capability such as very small objects or very precise manipulation tasks or vary big objects beyond current capabilities and functionalities; to manipulate complex articulated objects either as part of an assembly task or in order to use those objects as tools to achieve a specific function. For example handling a complex articulated part while a processing operation is taking place on it; or to manipulate and assemble soft objects or materials that deform under their own weight such as textiles as a part of a useful process.Step change in the enabling conditions essential for the accelerated diffusion of robots in various industries sectors and services which can 1) handle tasks efficiently robustly and safely and 2) interact naturally and smoothly to support humans in their daily activities based on a strong multidisciplinary approach including the relevant SSH dimension.The development use and exploitation of major advances in science and technology for the enhancement of European robotics in order to maintain Europe’s scientific excellence and ensure sovereignty of key technologies relevant to roboticsCreate opportunities to affect society in the longer term by contributing to impact on major broad societal challenges.Scope:For robots to be usefully and efficiently deployed to perform new activities in physical interaction with the real world requires an improvement in and expansion of the range of functionalities robots can deploy.This needs to take place in sectors where the capabilities of robots can be utilised to progress productivity in critical industries support European industries essential for sovereignty and in sectors with high impact across Europe such as manufacturing healthcare agri-food construction etc.In particular the following major areas of functional performance need to be progressed to the next level of performance:significant enhancement of navigation capabilities in order to enhance mobility (underwater on the ground in the air in the body in areas difficult to reach on rough terrain in unpredictable environments in areas including people or other moving agents etc.) particularly in highly dynamic and complex environments.extension of manipulation capabilities to address:large (of the order of metres to 10s of meters in scale) or heavy (of the order of 100kg to multiple 100kg )or small objects of millimetre or centimetre scale or smaller; or of objects that are soft deformable articulated delicate or hazardous objects;Each of these require significant advances in precision force speed re-planning physical perception grasping manipulation (including bi-manual) etc.) in order to achieve beyond human capability in manipulation and dexterity.For large scale manipulation applications include but are not limited to manufacturing assembly maintenance and installation of large infrastructure; for example wind turbines energy pylons pipelines dwellings industrial buildings transport infrastructure etc.)For small scale manipulation applications include but are not limited to medical and healthcare (human and animal) pharmaceutical and laboratory automation process industries materials processing and micro-fabrication and assembly.significant enhancement of functional interaction capabilities to deliver efficient safe and natural interaction with people objects with other robots within complex and dynamic working environments including the ability to adapt to variation in the working environment and the needs and dynamics of users objects and structures etc.).Making significant next step advances in these functional capabilities will require paradigm shifts in terms of both physical and systems architecture particularly through the removal of silos between disciplines that contribute to robotics functionalities.Proposals will need to address safety and security aspects at all levels as well as consider the data life cycle in line with GDPR.Proposals should aim to address bold and significant challenges to the enhancement of robot functionality and do so by utilising multidisciplinary research activities.Proposals should address several of the following in the context of improved functional performance relevant to deployment barriers in a high impact sector:Robust perception and the integration of sensing into physical structures to enhance motion and perceptionAdvanced safe and reliable navigation functionalities integrating anticipation re-planning high-level goal optimisation.

Ethics principles need to be adopted from early stages of development and design.Critical to success will be the interaction of End Users in the definition of the problem domains and use cases that act as barriers to long term deployment and uptake across multiple sectors.Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the following:Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in the necessary relevant disciplines to reach their objectives. SSH is particularly relevant in addressing human aspects related to human-robot interaction sensible task distribution between humans and robots agency control trust and handling of data collection to achieve usability trustworthiness safety and adoption of the developed solutions.It is essential that scientific and technological results are reproducible and re-usable in order to contribute to the advancement of the targeted research area.S&T progress should be demonstrated through use-cases with major and broad socio-economic impact.Projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European national or regional initiatives funding programmes.All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs benchmarking and progress monitoring as well as illustrative application use-cases demonstrating well-defined potential added value) and share communicable results with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform or Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics public community resources to maximise re-use of results either by developers or for uptake and optimise efficiency of funding; enhancing the European AI Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI data and robotics.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 2-3 and achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.,Digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal (2023/24)This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs) as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO A ‘Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital enabling and emerging technologies sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.’KSO C ‘Making Europe the first digitally led circular climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility energy construction and production systemsProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:Open strategic autonomy in digital technologies and in future emerging enabling technologies by strengthening European capacities in key parts of digital and future supply chains allowing agile responses to urgent needs and by investing in early discovery and industrial uptake of new technologies.Electronic and photonic components and the software that defines how they work are the key digital technologies that underpin all digital systems. As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe’s autonomy particularly in periods of geopolitical instability exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment electric and autonomous vehicles manufacturing and production plants and equipment telecom networks aerospace vehicles consumer productsR&I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality (“Internet of Senses”). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.Despite a strong European scientific community’s on AI and robotics Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing healthcare transport agriculture energy construction) providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.While Europe is strong in many sectors it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness prosperity and sustainability by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches use of biological elements as part of technology and sustainable smart materials. In particular the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118) in particular its ‘secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures’ pillar actions under this Destination will support Europe’s open strategic autonomy and reinforce and regain European industry’s leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain from low-power components to advanced systems future networks new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs values and expectations of society in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.As a result this Destination is structured into the following headings which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:European Innovation Leadership in PhotonicsThe European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘Photonics’.AI Data and RoboticsEurope has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research Europe’s scientific community is leading in AI and robotics but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies only capture 10% of full potential use and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis many AI Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore there is room for improved adoption by industry which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&I from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries from manufacturing to healthcare public sector utilities retail finance insurance transport agriculture energy telecommunications environmental monitoring construction media creative and cultural industries fashion tourism etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘AI Data and Robotics’.When it comes to Robotics Europe is leading in its industry with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics’ cognition safety manipulation soft robotics underwater and aerial robotics with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming fisheries horticulture etc. as well as produce processing ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]] forestry inspection and maintenance logistics construction manufacturing etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial marine ground in-vivo and space).The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics leading the way in research development and deployment of world-class technologies.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘AI Data and Robotics’.Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital AutonomyThe European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe’s global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).In the light of dominant players bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing Cloud Computing edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy – notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.European leadership in Emerging and Enabling TechnologiesEurope’s leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech though this intertwining is essential.The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe’s future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm ShiftSince 2018 the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe’s scientific leadership and excellence in quantum in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU’s aims for quantum R&I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship’s Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators[[Link to provide later]] which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing quantum simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing simulation sensing and communication in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership capitalising on Europe’s established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.The aim of the Commission’s Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used among others for sensitive applications in the area of security and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context the EU must take action to build on its strengths and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets interests autonomy and security while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025 with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact with applications in medicine manufacturing or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography finance and many other sensitive domains.Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU’s interests as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications sensors for autonomous vehicles and the next generation of medical sensors.It is therefore clearly in the EU’s interests to protect European research in these domains the intellectual property that it generates and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe’s strategic dependencies). With this in mind the Commission has decided that in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation communication and sensing only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.Graphene: Europe in the leadThe starting point is the Graphene Flagship launched in 2013 which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation automotive electronics batteries healthcare).The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing experimentation demonstration and support for take-up using the capacities infrastructures and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Europe’s open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI data robotics quantum computing and graphene and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain from low-power components to advanced systems future networks new data technologies and platforms.Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs values and expectations of society in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.As a result this Destination is structured into the following headings which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:European Innovation Leadership in PhotonicsThe European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments far above the average EU market share.

This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm ShiftSince 2018 the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe’s scientific leadership and excellence in quantum in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU’s aims for quantum R&I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship’s Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators[[Link to provide later]] which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing quantum simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing simulation sensing and communication in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership capitalising on Europe’s established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.The aim of the Commission’s Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty as they are of global strategic importance.

Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context the EU must take action to build on its strengths and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets interests autonomy and security while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation quantum communication and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025 with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030.

With this in mind the Commission has decided that in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation communication and sensing only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.Graphene: Europe in the leadThe starting point is the Graphene Flagship launched in 2013 which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation automotive electronics batteries healthcare).The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing experimentation demonstration and support for take-up using the capacities infrastructures and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Europe’s open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI data robotics quantum computing and graphene and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain from low-power components to advanced systems future networks new data technologies and platforms.Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Advances across these areas can help create human-centric AI[1] which reflects the needs and values of European citizens and contribute to an effective governance of AI technologies.To achieve robust and reliable AI novel approaches are needed to develop methods and solutions that work under other than model-ideal circumstances while also having an awareness when these conditions break down. To achieve trustworthiness AI system should be sufficiently transparent and capable of explaining how the system has reached a conclusion in a way that it is meaningful to the user while also indicating when the limits of operation have been reached.The purpose is to advance AI-algorithms that can perform safely under a common variety of circumstances reliably in real-world conditions and predict when these operational circumstances are no longer valid. The research should aim at advancing robustness and explainability for a generality of solutions while leading to an acceptable loss in accuracy and efficiency and with known verifiability and reproducibility. The focus is on extending the general applicability of explainability and robustness of AI-systems by foundational AI and machine learning research. To this end the following methods may be considered but are not necessarily restricted to:data-efficient learning transformers reinforcement learning federated and edge-learning automated machine learning or any combination thereof for improved robustness and explainability.hybrid approaches integrating learning knowledge and reasoning model-based approaches neuromorphic computing or other nature-inspired approaches and other forms of hybrid combinations which are generically applicable to robustness and explainability.continual learning active learning long-term learning and how they can help improve robustness and explainability.multi-modal learning natural language processing speech recognition and text understanding taking multicultural aspects into account for the purpose of increased operational robustness and the capability to explain alternative formulation[2].Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the following:Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in all the relevant disciplines and where appropriate Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) including gender and intersectional knowledge to address concerns around gender racial or other biases. etc.Proposals are expected to dedicate tasks and resources to collaborate with and provide input to the open innovation challenge under HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-04 addressing explainability and robustness. Research teams involved in the proposals are expected to participate in the respective Innovation Challenges.Contribute to making AI and robotics solutions meet the requirements of Trustworthy AI based on the respect of the ethical principles the fundamental rights including critical aspects such as robustness safety reliability in line with the European Approach to AI. Ethics principles needs to be adopted from early stages of development and design.All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs benchmarking and progress monitoring) and share communicable results with the European R&D community through the AI-on-demand platform or Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics public community resources to maximise re-use of results either by developers or for uptake and optimise efficiency of funding; enhancing the European AI Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.In order to achieve the expected outcomes international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Canada and India.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 2-3 and achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.[1]A European approach to artificial intelligence | Shaping Europe’s digital future (europa.eu)[2]Research should complement build upon and collaborate with projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-03: Natural Language Understanding and Interaction in Advanced Language Technologies,A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies (2023/24)This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs) as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D Creating a more resilient inclusive and democratic European society prepared and responsive to threats and disasters addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitionsProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies empowering end-users and workers and supporting social innovation.The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers developers high-tech SMEs and start-ups etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment building on a more resilient and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.In particular the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions workers regions and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations and will be differently affected by these changes creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living safer mobility better healthcare new jobs or the personalisation of public services. At the same time it presents risks such as skills mismatches digital divides customer lock-in or serious breaches of security or privacy.As Europe sets off on its path to recovery towards a greener digital and more resilient economy and society the need to improve and adapt skills knowledge and competences becomes all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments leading to a more inclusive society increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies following revelations about the exploitation of personal data large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65) for AI technologies trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability expected levels of performance). For the Internet increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches the need to empower all workers and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness public awareness and support wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs values and expectations of society in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.This Destination is structured into the following headings which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:Leadership in AI based on trustThe objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI leading the way in research development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually organisationally and societally and that adheres to European values such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership ‘AI Data and Robotics’.Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) in particular the EIT Digital.EIT Digital plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital through projects with cities for example improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past present or future to the benefit of citizens. ​An Internet of TrustThe issue of trust in the internet has become central following revelations about the exploitation of personal data large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey[[]] shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment built on a more resilient sustainable and decentralised internet to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.eXtended Reality (XR)Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society our children their parents and their teachers maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised innovative efficient and inclusive learning for learners of all ages gender and conditionThe objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments while ensuring the European values of privacy ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs) with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing experimentation demonstration and support for take-up using the capacities infrastructures and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.Digital Humanism and human compatible technologiesThe Digital Decade policy programme (“The Path to the Digital Decade”) sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.In parallel there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation in line with our values and principles.European standards for industrial competitivenessThe Communication ‘Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery’ made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&I projects allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities share views on future developments and stakeholder needs and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.International cooperationThe proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission’s international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan the Republic of Korea and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020]] sustainability of African digital ecosystems reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa’s economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&I.Additionally international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services EuroHPC and Key Digital Technologies).Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to a human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Increased inclusiveness by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values (including gender and intersectional aspects) as well as sustainability;Sustainable high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches the need to empower workers including those at risk of social exclusion and ethical considerations relating to technological progress[[2019 CIGI-Ipsos Global Survey on Internet Security and Trust]].Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Demonstrating how regions can operate within safe ecological and regional nitrogen and phosphorus boundaries,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl6-2024-zeropollution-01-1;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,17 October 2023,22 February 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Successful proposals will deliver to all actors involved in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) emitting activities in a given region a demonstrated set of measures to limit N/P emissions and re-balance N/P flows within safe ecological boundaries at regional and local scale thereby contributing to restoring ecosystems in line with the European Green Deal and the EU zero pollution action plan.Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Best practice including technical and governance solutions to reduce N/P emissions into water air and soil from all emitting sectors in line with relevant EU limit values;Demonstrated environmental economic and behavioural effects of aforementioned N/P limiting solutions while promoting local and regional sustainability and circular economy schemes;Comprehensive guidance on sustainable and circular practices to control regional N/P flows at regional level in the EU and recommendations to relevant actors (policymakers local administrations practitioners industries etc.).Scope:Building on recent innovations in regional N/P budgeting and quantification methodologies to ensure good status for air water and soil ecosystems this Innovation Action should demonstrate how to apply optimised N/P budgets based on maximum allowable inputs of N/P at a regional/river basin scale and create the necessary systemic and multi-actor transition pathways to ensure a sustainable integrated N/P management in the future. The aim is to show how N/P-relevant sectors (e.g. agriculture aquaculture forestry industrial sectors food/drink sector water supply water/waste management bioenergy fossil-based energy production mining activities transport unintentional losses through leaching and run-off of agricultural nutrients etc.) in a given region can limit N/P emissions to air water and soil from their activities by respecting pre-established regional N/P budgets and applying N/P balancing practices. N/P-balancing practices comprise activities that enhance the sustainability and circularity of N/P relevant resources and services between urban/industrial and rural/coastal environments and apply respective governance measures. Finally it will be essential to develop comprehensive guidelines to disseminate best practices and techniques to all involved actors.Proposals should:Implement a reliable N/P budgeting methodology to identify the maximum allowable input of N/P at regional/river basin scale and ensure good status for air water and soil ecosystems. N/P budgets should stay within safe ecological and regional boundaries i.e. by respecting limit values of N/P in air water and soil as specified in existing EU legislation[1] or based on recent scientific evidence[2] and complying with the precautionary principle.Demonstrate single or integrated region-specific practices in all relevant N/P sectors that help balance emissions from N and P-based fertilisers in agriculture enhance soil health reduce eutrophication and water pollution and limit harmful emissions to air.Showcase how innovative governance models can contribute to fostering ecologically responsible and sustainable use recovery and exchange of N/P relevant resources services and infrastructures between urban/industrial and rural/coastal environments while meeting overarching EU objectives (farm to fork and biodiversity strategies).Test innovative practices and technologies to make use of secondary raw materials and produce N and P-based fertilisers recovered from organic waste wastewater biological residues or by-products and promote local and regional value chains.Apply novel governance approaches and other incentives supporting practices to limit N/P emissions and develop respective guidelines and recommendations for all concerned stakeholders (local and regional authorities municipalities environmental organisations farmers and other practitioners industry civil society etc.) to encourage behavioural change and public acceptance of recovered products as well as more effective problem-solving mechanisms while envisaging regional twinning and mentoring schemes.Disseminate results and best practice to all stakeholders involved across the EU and Associated Countries and provide recommendations on the design of harmonised coherent and efficient regional policies and regulatory instruments that facilitate eliminating and preventing N/P pollution.Applicants are encouraged to join different regional clusters per project and to diversify their proposed consortia by involving a wide range of relevant stakeholders such as primary producers and practitioners local and regional administrations municipalities related industries environment organisations academia civil society citizens etc.The projects funded under this topic are expected to build close links and exchange knowledge and information with the Horizon Europe Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030”. In particular they should link to the Mission activities under Objective 2 – “Prevent minimise and eliminate pollution in marine and freshwater environment” and to the Mission lighthouse activities in the Mediterranean sea basin focusing on the prevention reduction and elimination of all kinds of pollution in marine and freshwater ecosystems including pollution from excess nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen).This topic will be part of the demonstration projects for the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and must be carried out in close cooperation with it.SSH aspects should be included.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 8 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.[1] EU Water Framework Directive Nitrates Directive.[2] EEA 2020 Is Europe living within the limits of our planet? An assessment of Europe's environmental footprints in relation to planetary boundaries’ https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/is-europe-living-within-the-planets-limits.,Clean environment and zero pollution (2023/24)Anthropogenic pollution undermines the integrity of Earth’s ecosystems and severely affects natural resources essential for human life. Keeping our planet clean and our ecosystems healthy will not only help addressing the climate crisis but also help regenerate biodiversity ensure the sustainability of primary production activities and safeguard the well-being of humankind. In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and related initiatives targeting environmental challenges particularly the EU zero pollution action plan the 2030 climate target plan and other relevant EU legislation[[]] this destination seeks to halt and prevent pollution by focusing on:removing pollution from fresh and marine waters soils air including from nitrogen and phosphorus emissions;substituting harmful chemicals;improving the environmental sustainability and circularity of bio-based systems;reducing environmental impacts of and pollution in food systems.Synergies with other clusters (notably 1 for health issues and 5 for air pollution from urban sources) relevant destinations missions (particularly ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’ and ‘Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030’) and partnerships will be exploited.Topics under the heading Halting pollution of air soil and water aim to identify and demonstrate approaches to combat diffuse emissions of pollutants from land and other sources. In this context keeping nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles in balance is a major challenge. N and P flows from anthropogenic sources mostly from excessive or inefficient input of fertilisers (manure sewage sludge etc.) in agriculture and from waste water treatments currently exceed planetary boundaries. Their leaching and run-off negatively affect soil biodiversity pH organic matter concentration and carbon sequestration capacity and cause the eutrophication of water bodies while ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions affect air quality and climate. As all environmental compartments are concerned a systemic approach is needed to limit N/P emissions from different sources and to bring N/P flows back within safe ecological boundaries e.g. by improving the way fertilising products in agriculture are managed while taking into account regional conditions. Actions will include showcasing best practices to recover nutrients from secondary raw materials in order to produce alternative fertilisers and demonstrating pathways for regions to keep their N/P flows within ecological boundaries.Topics under Protecting drinking water and managing urban water pollution seek to develop and demonstrate a comprehensive framework bringing together new innovative solutions and approaches to ensure drinking water is of a good quality address urban water pollution and harmonise different policies and management approaches. Actions should explore solutions to increase the resilience of urban waste water systems reducing the carbon footprint and emissions improve resource efficiency and energy recovery and limit risks from contaminants of emerging concern. An integrated strategy to harmonise and update monitoring with prioritisation for comprehensive control of urban water cycles should be developed by harnessing the potential of digital solutions.Topics under Addressing pollution in seas and ocean strive to fill knowledge gaps about risks and impacts of pollution from contaminants of emerging concern in the marine environment (in particular pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors) including in the context of the changing marine environment due to changes in the climate system. They will further develop and test solutions for the integrated assessment and monitoring of the circulation and impacts of contaminants of emerging concern in the marine environment in order to help implement EU policies and legislation e.g. the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Actions should also explore the role of pollution in intensifying impacts related to climate change including in the Arctic resulting in solutions and strategies to help ecosystems and human communities adapt as regards the changes in the Arctic.Topics under Increasing the environmental sustainability and circularity of bio-based processes and products look at developing bio-based solutions for environmental monitoring and remediation as well as the concept of integrating sustainability and circularity into bio-based systems. This concept also includes bio-based chemicals additives and materials solutions contributing to carbon removal objectives the chemicals strategy for sustainability (CSS strategy) and the development of safe- and -sustainable-by-design materials and products.Furthermore topics under the heading Reducing the environmental impact and pollution of food systems focus on increasing our knowledge of the soil water and air pollution stemming from different food production and supply practices and providing opportunities to reduce environmental and climate impacts of food systems. This also includes preventing and reducing plastic pollution stemming from plastic food packaging.Expected impactProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway that helps to halt and eliminate pollution to guarantee clean and healthy soils air fresh and marine water for all and ensure that natural resources are used and managed in a sustainable and circular manner. To reach this objective it will be vital to advance the knowledge of pollution sources and pathways to enable preventive measures to be rolled out improve sustainability and circularity apply planetary boundaries in practice and introduce effective remediation methods. To this end the following is required:move towards achieving clean unpolluted surface water and groundwater bodies in the EU and Associated Countries by increasing understanding of diffuse and point sources of water pollution in a global and climate change context enabling novel solutions to avoid degradation and restore water bodies aquatic ecosystems and soil functionality and further improve the quality and management of water for safe human and ecological use while strengthening the EU’s and Associated Countries’ positions and roles in the global water scene;balance N/P flows within safe ecological boundaries at regional and local level helping restore ecosystems;move towards achieving clean unpolluted oceans and seas including in the Arctic by means of successful scientific technological behavioural socio-economic governance and green-blue transitions;strengthen circular bio-based systems to operate within planetary boundaries replacing fossil-based systems and their carbon footprint mitigating climate change and restoring biodiversity and protecting air water and soil quality along the supply chain of biological feedstocks and industrial value chains within the EU and Associated Countries and across borders;substitute harmful chemicals for safer and more sustainable alternatives notably by boosting innovative biotechnology and other sustainable technologies to create zero-pollution bio-based solutions;reduce the environmental impact of food systems e.g. by increasing knowledge of the environmental and climate impacts stemming from the food systems and reducing pollution from plastic food packaging.,General conditions1.

Beyond the horizon: A human-friendly deployment of artificial intelligence and related technologies,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2024-transformations-01-06;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,04 October 2023,07 February 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Understanding and awareness raising about successful existing deployment of AI and the impact they have on European economy and society providing a reality check of capabilities/benefits but also limitations of current AI solutions and how the latter are currently addressed.On the basis of lessons from successful deployment analysis of the implementation of the ethics principles for trustworthy AI.Structurally enhanced capacities to foresee evaluate and manage the future and longer term opportunities and challenges associated with artificial intelligence and related technologies.Well founded and prioritised recommendations for European policy on R&I and in other key areas aimed at :Ensuring that Europe is prepared to exploit the opportunities for the benefit of citizens and society and at the same time face the challenges raised by potential developments and deployments of artificial intelligence and related technologies based on science and evidence as well as human rights and European values andReinforcing Europe’s capacity to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in ways aligned to human rights and European values.Scope:The history of “artificial intelligence” technologies (AI) is marked by great optimism and expectation sometimes followed by disappointment. However we have recently seen a sustained upsurge in interest and the successful uptake and application of AI in a variety of significant areas such as drug discovery autonomous vehicles social media industrial robotics and logistics to name a few. We have witnessed significant successes in the development and deployment of machine learning particularly for tasks normally associated with human perception[1]. We have also seen significant successes in symbolic and logic-driven AI for problems that require reasoning about constraints automated reasoning planning etc.[2] AI has had significant impact in the arts and humanities and AI-based methods and tools are becoming more widely used in the cultural arena.[3]Nevertheless today the collection of computer technologies commonly labelled artificial intelligence along with related technologies for instance in the fields of data science neuroscience and biotechnology already show the potential to disrupt and impact the rights of individuals and the wellbeing of societal structures. For example there have been many documented case studies where AI-based applications have exhibited undesired gender and racial bias[4]. AI systems have been (mis-)used to micro-target and influence voters in elections as well as in the creation and dissemination of disinformation[5] and otherwise impact on human agency and autonomy. Many ethical issues arise in the development of AI systems such as their use in medical devices brain-computer interfaces reasoning about human mental and emotion state etc.[6]Concerns are often raised that AI technologies may imply major societal disruptions such as massive job displacements due to the increasing use of AI-drive automation and robotics while research show that AI can also help filling gaps in workforce[7][8].In 2018 the European Commission established the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG-AI) which was tasked with developing a set of ethics guidelines for Europe that would help ensure that AI systems be human-centric and trustworthy. The importance of a human-centric approach to AI has been a cornerstone of EU policymaking in the field for several years and is the clearly articulated position of the EU. The European Commission published a pioneering draft AI Act in April 2021 the first legal framework on AI in Europe which addresses the potential risks of using AI[9]. The Horizon Europe work programme under Cluster 4 is funding related research and innovation actions under the header ‘Leadership in AI based on trust’.The common principle across all of these EU initiatives are seven key requirements for trustworthy AI[10] as proposed by the HLEG-AI and adopted by the European Commission as well as the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of individuals[11].Against this backdrop before being faced with a ‘fait-accompli’ in terms of potentially undesirable influence of AI on the European society and economy and to make sure that all the beneficial potential of AI deployment is fully realised we should anticipate and prepare for possible and high impact scenarios.The proposal should cover all the following aspects:Decisive contributions to develop a sound European capacity building on the future and long term human and societal implications of AI building as appropriate on previous work of the HLEG-AI ADRA[12] and current development of the AI Act or other relevant European and national AI initiatives.A solid scientific approach providing an in-depth analysis of successful existing deployment of AI and the impact they have on European economy and society. Such analysis should also significantly contribute to awareness raising of such deployments providing a reality check of capabilities/benefits but also limitations of current AI solutions and how the latter are currently addressed.Scenario based analysis of future and long term potential benefits to citizens and societies as well as an analysis of related challenges and threats.Based on this proposals for development and deployment of AI should ensure a broad support and appropriate involvement of other relevant AI initiatives taking into account guiding ethics principles and the current development of the AI Act.Proposals need to take a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial approach and engage with a wide set of stakeholders including research organisations enterprises citizens[13] policymakers public private partnerships in particular the AI Data and Robotics Partnership and other relevant EU projects and initiatives around AI.European policy actions should be proposed in a priority order notably in the area of research and innovation but not excluding other important policy areas that would serve to strengthen European preparedness and resilience in the face of future developments within AI and related emerging technologies as well as to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in a desirable direction.Proposals should build on existing knowledge activities and networks such as the HLEG-AI and other initiatives funded by the European Union. Funded proposals should also take into account existing EU policy in the area such as the development of the AI Act and the Excellence and trust in artificial intelligence under A Europe fit for the digital age[14]. Furthermore the proposals should seek synergies with closely related actions such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020[15].[1] https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/deep-learning-applications/[2] https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/11/symbolic-ai-the-key-to-the-thinking-machine/[3] https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04448-z[4] https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Missions/14458/Gender-and-AI-Addressing-bias-in-artificial-intelligence[5] https://il.boell.org/en/2022/01/27/ai-and-elections-observations-analyses-and-prospects[6] See for example https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/30/143155/with-brain-scanning-hats-china-signals-it-has-no-interest-in-workers-privacy/[7] https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-europe[8] The Global Health Care Worker Shortage: 10 Numbers to Note | Project HOPE[9] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence[10] https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines/1.html[11] https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence[12] Home - Ai Data Robotics Partnership (ai-data-robotics-partnership.eu)[13] of different age groups incl. children and young people as well as elderly people[14] See further[15] Such as the Networks of AI excellence centres funded under H2020 and Horizon Europe the AI on Demand Platform as well as projects funded under Destination 6 (Leadership in AI based on trust) of Cluster 4 of the HE Work Programme.,Innovative research on social and economic transformations (2023/24)Europe is being transformed by changes that impact the livelihoods and wellbeing of its citizens. Such changes present important opportunities for the EU to innovate and shape forward looking inclusive societies and economies while avoiding the mistakes of the past and promoting an inclusive recovery that strengthens economic and social resilience. However demographic changes digitalisation automation new ways of working environmental degradation armed conflicts energy dependency the transition to a low carbon economy health threats and globalisation all pose multidimensional interconnected and complex social and economic challenges. At the same time there has been an increase in inequality poverty and social exclusion a polarisation of skill needs in the labour market and a slowdown in convergence in income and employment in most European countries. Inequalities including housing inequalities threaten social and territorial cohesion economic growth and wellbeing. Moreover the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have magnified the pervasive inequalities across European societies with significant differences in the way losses and costs of these crises are distributed in society. To seize the opportunities emerging from socio-economic transformations including the digital and green transitions in a strongly connected and integrated world these challenges need to be better understood and tackled.Population ageing increases social protection spending on pensions health and long-term care and restricts the capacity of the redistributive system to reduce inequality. Policies need to support a transition towards more environmentally-friendly ways of producing and providing private and public services while ensuring all regions and individuals equally benefit from these transitions and that no one is left behind in particular when it comes to employment and access to essential services. The European Pillar of Social Rights[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/economy-works-people/jobs-growth-and-investment/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20-principles_en]] tries to pave the way towards fair and well-functioning labour markets and social protection systems. Access to social protection for those in need should be ensured while making sure that everyone can participate in economic social political and cultural developments. Social protection supports individuals in emergencies that they can no longer cope with on their own and in addition protects them by means of long-term measures – whether in the event of illness accident disabilities need for care (including childcare and long-term care) unemployment or old age. Moreover mitigation and adaptation strategies are essential to make sure population movements shaped by these transitions are positive for all areas and do not contribute to deepening the divide between regions or countries.Education and training are key long-term factors in preventing and reversing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities inclusion and social mobility. However the educational outcomes of young people are still determined to a large extent by the socio-economic status of their parents rather than by their own potential. Without connecting to other social policies education and training systems may not be able to compensate for all societal inequality however they have a vital role to play in breaking these patterns and creating a fair and inclusive society. In this context it is important to reflect on the nature of economic growth and the need to better capture the different dimensions of social progress including sustainable economic policy paradigms. It is increasingly important to distinguish between the different purposes of measurement: economic activity social and cultural well-being and sustainability and to develop relevant indicators. This is particularly the case as the pervasive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the economic performance and socio-economic fabric of many countries in Europe bringing also to the fore mental health related issues loneliness and their socio-economic impacts affecting the well-being of citizens.Migration has been a critical component of the makeup of European societies requiring comprehensive and coordinated European responses in order to ripen its benefits both inside and outside the EU. The task of research is to better understand migration in a global and EU context assist in its governance support security and help the socio-economic as well as civil-political inclusion of migrants in European societies. It can enhance policies and in particular the EU's agenda on migration as it is expressed in the New Pact for Asylum and Migration[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/migration-and-asylum-package-new-pact-migration-and-asylum-documents-adopted-23-september-2020_en]].The implementation of the research activities in the two calls of this Destination will contribute to a comprehensive and reflective European strategy for inclusive growth including social economic ecological and historical dimensions. It will also contribute to promote research actions and outputs that help design implement and monitor a socially just and inclusive green and digital transition notably in relation to social and economic transformations inclusiveness skills development and sustainability. Furthermore actions will deal with the long-term challenges in education and training talent and labour market and the resilience of our societies. This will strengthen the resilience of the EU and of its citizens and will ensure that no one is left behind despite instability and in the face of old and new risks. It will equally support productivity gains and their fair distribution as well as boosting social and economic resilience that is essential to face situations of unexpected crises such as in the case of COVID-19 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The overall knowledge generated including a holistic understanding of societal well-being will feed into the design of policy strategies in line with the above mentioned objectives and will facilitate the assessment of policy needs and outcomes in the field of the societal and economic transformations.The Destination calls for proposals that may help in reaching these key strategic policy objectives in the EU. It invites proposals to do so by integrating feedback loops with stakeholders and policymakers that may help in developing suggestions and recommendations throughout their lifecycles. These proposals should take into consideration the stakeholders associated to the decisions that are suggested and should also account for the context in which decisions are made. Therefore in order to maximise and facilitate the uptake of group-sensitive recommendations in policy they should include analyses of political and financial trade-offs associated to the recommendations produced reflecting also on contextual changes needed to implement proposals developed. Proposals are also invited to build upon previous research funded by Horizon 2020 valorising its experience and findings.Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following targeted expected impacts of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:Social and economic resilience and sustainability are strengthened through a better understanding of the social ethical political and economic impacts of drivers of change (such as technology globalisation demographics mobility and migration) and their interplay.Inclusive growth is boosted and vulnerabilities are reduced effectively through evidence-based policies for protecting and enhancing employment education social fairness and tackling inequalities including in response to the socio-economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,General conditions1.

"Furthering the development of a materials acceleration platform for sustainable batteries (combining AI, big data, autonomous synthesis robotics, high throughput testing) (Batt4EU Partnership)",Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2024-d2-01-05;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,07 December 2023,18 April 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Batteries have complex and dynamic processes taking place in and between materials and at the interfaces/interphases within a battery cell. For each new battery chemistry explored new challenges in understanding these processes are revealed. To accelerate the finding of new materials and their combinations for both existing and future battery chemistries the iterative and fragmented trial and error approach used today needs to be replaced since it is slow and insufficient.To accelerate the discovery of battery interfaces materials and new sustainable concepts with high energy and/or power performance there is a need to develop a fully autonomous and chemistry neutral Materials Acceleration Platform (MAP) for battery materials and interfaces. This is a key and long-term challenge for European battery community. The aim is to integrate advanced multi-scale computational modelling materials synthesis characterisation and testing to perform closed-loop autonomous materials findings and interphase engineering that would accelerate by at least a factor of five the discovery of new battery chemistries with ultra-high performances.Building upon the shared data infrastructure standards and protocols developed in the BATTERY 2030+ initiative this call topic addresses the need of increasing the level of autonomy in the MAP-based discovery and development process. The proposal should also cover the contribution and collaboration to the BATTERY 2030+ large scale initiative.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomesDevelop new tools and methods for significantly accelerating the development and optimisation of battery materials and interfaces in order to increase the competitiveness of the battery material and cell industry in Europe.Demonstrate a fully autonomous battery-MAP capable of integrating computational modelling materials synthesis and characterisation of both Li-ion and beyond Li-ion chemistries.Scale-bridging multi-scale battery interface models capable of integrating data from embedded sensors in the discovery and prediction process e.g. to orchestrate proactive self-healing.Community wide state-of-the-art collaborative environment to access data and utilise automated workflows for integrated simulations and experiments on heterogeneous sites e.g. exploiting European HPC architectures and Large-scale facilities in collaboration with LENS and LEAPS.Demonstrate a robotic system that is capable of material synthesis for inorganic organic or hybrid compounds following standard synthesis routes via automated characterisation of intermediate and final products and autonomous decision-making.Deploy predictive hybrid physics- and data-driven models for the spatio-temporal evolution of battery interfaces and demonstrate inverse design of a battery material/interface.Scope:Infrastructure tools for secure remote data access data analysis and predictive modelling: Develop a FAIR[1] data infrastructure for raw and curated experimental and modelling data which can be accessed remotely and securely by relevant stakeholders including industry. Develop the software infrastructure required to operate this platform also with regard to future reproducibility and further exploitation of the results of the research activities. The software should provide specific access right and allow remote data access complemented by distributed workflows using software-agnostic workflow engines that provide rapid-prototyping. Inverse materials design using hybrid physics- and data-driven battery interface genome models should also be demonstrated.Automated high throughput characterisation and integrated experimental and computational workflows: High throughput multimodal operando experimental techniques using standardised battery cells and established protocols should be optimised to perform effective screening of new materials and on-line diagnosis of realistic devices. A central objective is to establish structure operate and dynamically refine such facility platform to harmonise mutualise and optimise the global demand for battery characterisation. This includes automated experimental and computational workflows and modules for data acquisition and multimodal/multiscale analysis. Particular attention should be paid to battery interfaces and direct observation of interfaces under dynamic conditions which are key to improve the performances and the lifetime of batteries.Autonomous synthesis robotics and orchestration software: The transition from low/no automated robotics for the synthesis of battery materials requires several R&I steps towards fully autonomous systems. Within the scope of this proposed call are partially autonomous systems following standard synthesis routes for inorganic and organic battery materials especially also multi-step and high-temperature synthesis that so far are challenging to automate for high throughput. AI-based orchestration and optimisation software modules and packages specifically targeting battery materials and interfaces are also central to the scope.Inverse design and AI-assisted scale-bridging models for multiple time- and length-scale processes: To develop scale-bridging models correctly describing the multiple mechanisms occurring at atomistic scale and the mesoscopic scale on the cell level. The new model approaches should be able to incorporate data from the advanced sensing in virtual design optimisation and battery control algorithms for SoX estimation. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of the developed SoX models is also a requirement to assess the robustness of the developed models. These models should achieve a challenge based rational balance of accuracy and computational effort. They should accurately describe the actual state of the system but also enable diagnosis and prediction e.g. when self-healing procedures should be initiated. Multiscale Modelling approaches should be developed for the control of safety between BOL (Beginning Of Life) and EOL (End of Life) of a battery system by different uses and diagnosing the safety state of a battery system by innovative methods.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As such projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 3-4 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.[1] FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable),Cross-sectoral solutions for the climate transition (2023/24)This Destination covers thematic areas which are cross-cutting by nature and can provide key solutions for climate energy and mobility applications. In line with the scope of cluster 5 such areas are batteries hydrogen[[ The bulk of activities are supported by the Institutional Partnership ‘Clean Hydrogen’.]] communities and cities[[ Communities and cities are mainly supported under the Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities and through the co-funded Partnership ‘Driving Urban Transition’ implemented in this work programme as a grant to identified beneficiary.]] early-stage breakthrough technologies as well as citizen engagement[[ Citizens engagement as well as social sciences and humanities are mainstreamed across multiple topics across various Destinations in this work programme.]]. Although these areas are very distinct in terms of challenges stakeholder communities and expected impacts they have their cross-cutting nature as a unifying feature and are therefore grouped if not addressed in other places of this work programme under this Destination.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility energy construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ ‘Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy’ as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 – 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital enabling and emerging technologies sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;D: Creating a more resilient inclusive and democratic European society prepared and responsive to threats and disasters addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions.It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for peopleAffordable and clean energySmart and sustainable transportThe expected impact in line with the Strategic Plan is to contribute to the “Clean and sustainable transition of the energy and transport sectors towards climate neutrality facilitated by innovative cross-cutting solutions” notably through:Nurturing a world-class European research and innovation eco-system on batteries along the value chain based on sustainable pathways. It includes improvement of technological performance to increase application user attractiveness (in particular in terms of safety cost user convenience fast charging and environmental footprint) in parallel supporting the creation of a competitive circular and sustainable European battery manufacturing value chain (more detailed information below).Nurturing the development of emerging technologies with high potential to enable zero-greenhouse gas and negative emissions in energy and transport (more detailed information below).A competitive and sustainable European battery value chainBatteries will enable the rollout of zero-emission mobility and renewable energy storage contributing to the European Green Deal and supporting the UN SDGs by creating a vibrant responsible and sustainable market. Besides climate neutrality batteries also contribute to other UN SDGs directly and indirectly such as enabling of decentralized and off-grid energy solutions.The strategic pathway is on the one hand for Europe to rapidly regain technological competitiveness in order to capture a significant market share of the new and fast-growing rechargeable battery market and on the other hand to invest in longer term research on future battery technologies to establish Europe's long term technological leadership and industrial competitivenessThe Partnership “Towards a competitive European industrial battery value chain for stationary applications and e-mobility” with as short name Batt4EU to which all battery-related topics under this Destination will contribute aims to establish world-leading sustainable and circular European battery value chain to drive transformation towards a carbon-neutral society.The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting the battery value chain under this Destination are:Increased global competitiveness of the European battery ecosystem through generated knowledge and leading-edge technologies in battery materials cell design manufacturing and recycling.Significant contribution to the policy needs of the European Green Deal through new solutions for circularity and recycling of batteries.Accelerated growth of innovative competitive and sustainable battery manufacturing industry in Europe.Development of sustainable and safe technologies and systems for decarbonisation of transport and stationary applications.Contributing to the strategic independence of Europe through investigation of alternative battery chemistries using non-critical raw materials and efficient recycling technologies.Increasing synergies with other partnerships and initiatives.Emerging breakthrough technologies and climate solutionsAlthough the contribution of a wide range of technologies to reach climate neutrality is already foreseeable EU R&I programming should also leave room for emerging and break-through technologies with a high potential to achieve climate neutrality. These technologies can play a significant role in reaching the EU’s goal to become climate neutral by 2050.Relevant topics supported under this Destination complement the activities supported under Pillars I or III. They address emerging technologies that can enable the climate transition with a technology-neutral bottom-up approach. Research in this area is mostly technological in nature but should also where relevant be accompanied by assessments of environmental social and economic impacts by identification of regulatory needs and by activities supporting the creation of value chains to build up new ecosystems of stakeholders working on breakthrough technologies.The main expected impacts to be generated by the topic targeting breakthrough technologies and climate solutions under this Destination are:Emergence of unanticipated technologies enabling emerging zero-greenhouse gas and negative emissions in energy and transport;Development of high-risk/high return technologies to enable a transition to a net greenhouse gas neutral European economy.,General conditions1.

In line with the scope of cluster 5 this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner more secure and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings mobility industry) and integration of other climate neutral renewable energy carriers such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical mechanical electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan’s Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility energy construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ ‘Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy’ as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 – 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital enabling and emerging technologies sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;Affordable and clean energy.The expected impact in line with the Strategic Plan is to contribute to “More efficient clean sustainable secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions” notably throughFostering European global leadership in affordable secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers consumers networks infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below).Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power heating/cooling transportation agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and especially local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability security sustainability and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy photovoltaics solar thermal bioenergy or hydropower) and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore advanced renewable fuels including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the “do not significantly harm” principle for the environment research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use circularity pollution and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.Regarding the REPowerEU communication renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels. Most of the topics in this work programme are centred along two of the REPowerEU tracks with the remainder of the topics fully contributing to decreasing the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels:PV wind energy and heat pumps encompassing the most readily available renewable energy technologies to reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels. (17 topics)Renewable fuels encompassing the most readily available technologies (advanced biofuels) but also the less mature ones (synthetic renewable fuels). Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels and in particular advanced biofuels contribute to reduce the EU’s dependence because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels utilizing the existing infrastructure. (8 topics)The remainder of the topics also contributes to the objective of decreasing the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels with the focus either on specific renewable energy sectors (bioenergy geothermal hydropower ocean energy and solar thermal) or on cross-technology activities (next generation renewable energy market measures international cooperation). (18 topics)Main expected impacts:Availability of disruptive sustainable renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies & systems accelerating the replacement of fossil-based energy technologies to achieve climate neutrality in the energy sector by 2050 considering future climate conditions and without harming biodiversity environment and natural resources.Reduced cost and improved efficiency of sustainable renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies and their value chains.Support de-risking of sustainable renewable energy and fuel technologies with a view to their commercial exploitation to contribute to the 2030 “Fit for 55” targets increasing the share of renewable electricity heat and fuels in the EU energy consumption (in particular 40% renewable energy overall 2.2% advanced biofuels and 2.6% renewable fuels of non-biological origin).Better integration of sustainable renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions in all economic sectors including through digital technologies.Enhanced security and autonomy of energy supply in the EU while accelerating the green transition.Affordable secure and sustainable energy solutions to diversify gas supplies in the EU by increasing the level of biomethane.Reinforced European scientific basis and European export potential for renewable energy technologies through international collaborations (e.g. the AU-EU Climate Change and Sustainable Energy partnership the missions and innovation communities of Mission Innovation 2.0).Enhanced sustainability of renewable energy and renewable fuels value chains taking fully into account circular economy social economic and environmental aspects in line with the European Green Deal priorities.More effective market uptake of sustainable renewable energy and fuel technologies to support their commercialisation and provide inputs to policy making.Increased knowledge on the environmental impacts of the different renewable energy technologies along their lifecycle and value chains.Energy systems grids and storageMain expected impacts:Increased resilience of the energy system based on improved and/or new technologies and energy vectors to control the system and maintain system stability under difficult circumstances.Increased flexibility and resilience of the energy system to plan and operate different networks for different energy carriers simultaneously in a coordinated manner that will also contribute to climate neutrality of hard-to-electrify sectors.Innovative data-driven services for consumers that empower them to engage in the energy transition.

Demonstrating these technologies at industrial scale should pave the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind industrial projects.Reduced cost of the CCUS value chain with CO2 capture being still the most relevant stumbling block for a wider application of CCUS. Develop innovative technology for CO2 conversion to reduce the need for pre-concentration and/or purification.Adequate frameworks for Measurement Monitoring and Verification (MMV) for storage and use projects to document safe storage and for public buy-in of the technology.Further research in DACCS and BECCS as CO2 capture technologies in combination with CO2 storage in order to deliver carbon removals.in view of achieving the net zero targets.Assess the environmental impacts and risks in the short medium and long term of CCUS technologies with respect to the Do No Significant Harm principle and to inter-generational solidarity.,General conditions1.

Next generation AI and Human Behaviour: promoting an ethical approach,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-widera-2024-era-01-12;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,06 December 2023,12 March 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:In order to promote a responsible trustworthy and human-centric design and development of the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) proposed actions are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:The operationalisation of available general guidance on the ethics of AI into practical specific guidelines. These guidelines will focus on the impact of AI on human cognition and behaviour. The guidelines must also address the ethics dimension of the study of human behaviour and cognition in developing and improving AI systems. The guidelines should incorporate ethics into the relevant research and development processes and take into account strategies for ensuring adequate participation of all those affected by the development deployment and use of the relevant applications;Develop and validate education and training material reflecting the produced guidelines. This should be based on participatory processes involving all relevant stakeholders including citizen groups and industry.Scope:While the European Union has been a front runner in the global effort to formulate guidelines and regulate AI it is certain that the road ahead will be full of challenges. One of the key challenges is that the meaning and appropriate interpretation of the key concepts and principles in AI guidelines will often be highly context specific. For example the ethical risks related to the development or use of AI-based techniques for emotion recognition might be very different when applied for recruitment and selection purposes than when used for detecting levels of distress to assist in dealing with emergency calls or to detect situations of abuse. Similarly AI-enabled differentiation based on physical characteristics may be unethical in the context of law enforcement but useful in a medical context.At the same time research and development of AI-based application surges in all domains from education over measuring consumer behaviour to assisting in making important decisions such as supporting the mental health of people promoting driver safety and filtering job candidates.Current developments and learning in the field of AI come from a strong collaboration of multidisciplinary teams working together to acquire further knowledge on human cognition and behaviour in order to understand predict and impact human behaviour (e.g. for improving health or sustainability). To develop affective AI systems researchers aim to improve their understanding of the way the human brain learns and transfers knowledge. Potentially this understanding will help to build explainable trustworthy and human-centric AI systems and processes. However while systems for automatic emotion recognition and sentiment analysis can be facilitators of enormous progress (e.g. in improving public health and commerce) they are also enablers of considerable harm (e.g. acting against dissidents manipulating voters).In addition to ensuring the protection of research participants research ethics review plays a pivotal role in facilitating the integration of ethical concerns into research projects and protocols from the conception phase. While ensuring the development of ethical AI will require technical solutions - for example to improve transparency and explainability - guidance for the operationalisation of AI ethical principles (in a non-technical manner) needs to be developed and continuously evaluated in light of new developments in the field (in particular the increasing in-depth study of human behaviour in AI research and development).Therefore as policy-makers and AI actors around the world move from principles to implementation the action should:To better understand the ethical challenges (1) associated with the study of human behaviour and cognition to support the development or improve AI systems and (2) related to the impact of AI on human cognition and behaviour the current landscape should be reviewed and three chosen exemplary areas of research can be selected (such as of emotion recognition applications deep learning and general intelligence);Establish specialised inclusive networks of expertise comprised of multidisciplinary teams (including amongst others engineers data scientists legal experts ethicists cognitive researchers researchers with expertise in other relevant areas research administrators and policy experts);In collaboration with the networks of experts and based on findings and case-studies develop operational guidelines for AI systems that build on the study of human cognition and behaviour. These guidelines should incorporate ethics into the relevant research and design processes and facilitate the ethical assessment and auditing of research projects and outcomes (including toolboxes for algorithmic impact assessment). The guidelines should target the research community with an emphasis on early career researchers as well as the ethics experts (e.g. members of ethics review committees) and project managers. The developed guidelines must adjust the ethics-by-design approaches (as included in the guidelines Ethics by Design and Ethics of Use Approaches for Artificial Intelligence[1]) to the relevant areas of study and development. These should include mechanisms to assess ‘ethics readiness levels’ for the relevant ‘technology readiness levels’ and encompass the relevant mechanisms to incorporate ethics-enhancing methods directly in the design of the research protocols and prototypes (e.g. privacy-enhancing technologies explainability human-centred approach in design);Develop a toolbox for international cooperation in AI research and development in the relevant areas taking into account the regulatory and ethical landscape in key strategic partners (for example China the Republic of Korea Japan Canada and the US). Incorporate principles of benefit sharing in AI research and development in accordance with the Global Code of Conduct for Research in Resource-Poor Settings (TRUST Code)[2];As a result of the above activities this action should also produce innovative training material (reflecting the guidelines) for students early career and experienced researchers. In addition Framework Programme ethics appraisal scheme experts should be trained (250-300). Close attention should be paid to gender balance as well as to gender equality- and diversity-related ethical aspects. Feedback of the trainees should be used to improve the trainings.All activities proposed must be based on multidisciplinary inclusive networks of expertise including amongst others engineers data scientists AI legal experts ethicists cognitive researchers linguists and educators as well as private sector representatives. Every effort should be made to achieve a 45% - higher- female participation especially among students researchers and experts. This should also involve relevant ethics and integrity networks such as ENERI (European Network of Research Ethics Committees and Research Integrity Offices)[3] and ENRIO[4] or (associations of) European networks of (early) career researchers and/or educators in the field of research ethics and integrity. In addition in order to improve the impact of the expected output (such as effectiveness of training courses guidelines toolboxes etc.) cooperation with research management offices and ethics officers in Research Performing Organisations is highly recommended.In order to achieve the expected outcomes cooperation with at least two actors from Japan China the Republic of Korea and/or African countries not associated to Horizon Europe is required.It is important to ensure that the publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects (e.g. SHERPA SIENNA TechEthos) [5] and the TRUSTWORTHY AI project[6] are taken into account and that cooperation is envisaged with the beneficiaries of the Call HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ERA2023 01-12 – The future role and format of research ethics review in the changing research environments”.Consortia with EU partners or Associated Countries partners that have not previously collaborated are encouraged to participate.Budgeted cooperation (including the necessary technical aspects) with the Embassy of Good Science must be included in the proposal and the output material of the action must be made available on this e-platform.Finally the action should aim at valorising and widely disseminating the material produced beyond the community of ethics and integrity experts in particular by promoting its use for the students and young researchers that will constitute the next generation of ethics experts and reviewers. The priorities of the EU Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027)[7] should be taken into account. In this perspective cooperation should be sought with large university/research networks in order to enrich the relevant ethics related curriculum with the material produced by the action. In addition National Contact Points should be provided with all the materials relevant to support their advisory activities.For all deliverables and academic publications produced in the context of the activities an authorship contribution statement should be added in accordance with a recognised standardised taxonomy developed for this purpose (e.g. CRediT).[1]https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ethics-by-design-and-ethics-of-use-approaches-for-artificial-intelligence_he_en.pdf[2]https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/coc_research-resource-poor-settings_en.pdf[3] http://eneri.eu/[4]http://www.enrio.eu/[5] Detailed information of the mentioned EU-funded projects can be found on CORDIS website: https://cordis.europa.eu/[6]https://www.trustworthyaiproject.eu/framework-for-trustworthy-ai-education/[7]https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en,Reforming and enhancing the EU research and innovation system (2023/24)IntroductionHorizon Europe has a new level of ambition – to maximise the impact of the European Union's research and innovation funding for European science the economy and the wider society. It marks a paradigm change in the design of the European R&I framework programmes (FP) from an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme. Coupled to this ambition is the relaunch of the European Research Area (ERA) as described in the Commission Communication “A new ERA for Research and Innovation” (COM/2020/628 final of 30.09.2020).The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of R&I cooperation to provide solutions to society’s most demanding needs. With the priority on delivering Europe’s recovery as well as on the green and digital twin transitions a new level of ambition linking R&I better with the economy and with education and training is needed to match these challenges and put scientific knowledge to work.The new ERA calls for deepening existing priorities and creating new initiatives by strengthening the mobility of researchers and the free flow of knowledge and technology to improve access to excellence boost market uptake and prioritise investment and reform. Working together has been the philosophy of the ERA since its launch; however the green and digital transitions and the COVID recovery call for more and closer cooperation between the Commission the Member States and stakeholders. They require the setting of new priorities launching ambitious joint initiatives and developing common approaches between policies.To address these requirements Destination 3 of part 11 of the Horizon Europe work programme will support efforts to reform and enhance the European R&I system. Destination 3 is built around four strands corresponding to the four objectives set out in the ERA Communication:Prioritising investments and reforms in research and innovation;Improving access to excellence progressing towards excellence across the whole EU and striving for stronger research and innovation systems;Translating R&I results into the economy to meet the digital and green transition objectives and boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies;Deepening the ERA to further progress the free circulation of knowledge and to ensure an upgraded efficient and effective R&I system.The principle of excellence meaning that the best researchers with the best ideas that offer the best solutions to the societal challenges obtain funding remains the cornerstone for all investments under the ERA.Strand 1 recognises the importance of prioritising investments and reforms to accelerate the green and digital transformation and to increase competitiveness as well as the speed and depth of the recovery. It offers support for policy-makers and addresses the need for better analysis and evidence including simplifying and facilitating the inter-play between national and European R&I systems.Strand 2 addresses the need to improve access to excellence and to increase the performance of R&I systems building on dedicated Horizon Europe measures as well as complementarities with smart specialisation strategies under the Cohesion Policy.Strand 3 focuses on the importance of translating R&I results into the economy. R&I policies should aim to boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies.Strand 4 addresses the challenge of deepening the ERA and includes Open Science Higher Education and Researchers Citizen Science Science Education Gender and Ethics. It aims at underpinning a new ERA benefitting from knowledge creation circulation and use. This empowers higher education institutions and research organisations to embrace a transformative process; where a highly skilled workforce can circulate freely; and where research outputs are shared; where gender equality is assured; where the outcomes of R&I are understood trusted and increasingly used by educated informed scientists and citizens to the benefit of society.Expected impact:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts focussing on those that are most relevant to the respective topic:Reform and enhance of the European R&I system;Prioritisation of investments and reforms accomplish the recovery and the twin transitions;Improved access to excellence;High quality scientific production and stronger translation of R&I results into the economy;Deepen the ERA;Coordinated national and regional R&I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies;Improved knowledge for policy making about the networking patterns of research support staff and research management;Synergies between research & innovation and higher education policies and programmes;Modernised higher education sector adressing higher education research and innovation;Increased number of interconnected knowledge ecosystems strong in knowledge creation circulation and use;Researchers benefitting from attractive careers;Inclusive gender equality is promoted in the European research and innovation system;A more open and inclusive research and innovation system;Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science;Increased engagement of citizens with research and innovation;Increased alignment of strategic research with societal needs expectations and values;Identify synergies between second and third level education and between education and business;Increased trust in science and R&I outcomes and greater two-way communication between science and society;Knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely;Improved capacities within the EU R&I system to conduct open science;A more open and inclusive research and innovation system.,General conditions1.

Approaches and tools for security in software and hardware development and assessment,Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl3-2024-cs-01-01;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,27 June 2024,20 November 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:Improved hardware and software security engineering; resilient systems design;Improved access to testing of hardware and software in virtual closed and secure environments;Systematic and where possible automated study of vulnerabilities software analysis vulnerability discovery and dynamic security assessment;Trustworthy certifiable hardware and software;AI-based security services e.g. predictive security advanced anomaly and intrusion detection system health checks.Scope:Software is at the foundation of all digital technologies and as such at the core of IT infrastructures services and products. Current software development prioritises fast deployment over security which results in vulnerabilities and unsecure applications. Security engineering both at the software and hardware levels must be integrated in their development. Whilst a great portion of the software and hardware used in the EU is developed outside the European Union it should comply with the security requirements within the EU. The EU should be able to rely on software and hardware that can be verified and audited as to their security. In particular the potential security implications of using open-source software and hardware and security auditability in that context should be further explored. Software is subject to continuous update so the security posture cannot be assessed once and for all hence methods and tooling to perform continuous assessments of security are needed.

Therefore the pollutants expected to be quantified should go beyond the list of the currently regulated ones.Since accessing ships and aircrafts for testing is not straightforward and no fuel or engine development work should be funded in the proposals cooperation with existing projects where such fuels are tested is expected.A study of possible mitigation actions should focus on any new pollutants that have a high toxicity a high global warming potential or both.The potential from upstream emissions and of secondary pollutants formation in the atmosphere deriving from the new emissions should also be considered and quantified. Any trade-offs between GHG effects over the next 20-year period health and other environmental impacts should be identified and assessed.The projects should assess impacts on human health in particular those of any emerging pollutants.In consideration of the above proposals should address all the aforementioned aspects and issues in order to achieve the expected outcomesSpecific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.[1]https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_,"Clean and competitive solutions for all transport modes (2023/24)This Destination addresses activities that improve the climate and environmental footprint as well as competitiveness of different transport modes.The transport sector is responsible for 23% of CO2 emissions and remains dependent on oil for 92% of its energy demand.

Advanced digital development tools to accelerate the development of software defined vehicles that enable zero-emission mobility (2ZERO Partnership),Horizon Europe (HORIZON),"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2024-d5-01-05;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=false;typeCodes=1,2,8;statusCodes=31094502,31094501;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",Forthcoming,07 December 2023,18 April 2024 17:00:00 Brussels time,ExpectedOutcome:Advanced digital tools can enable the mobility industry to efficiently develop and operate software-defined electric vehicles that are key for achieving sustainable mobility solutions. Core functions of the electric powertrain or vehicle dynamics are primarily enabled and controlled via software. Function updates are at the fingertip of the end-users to offer maximum customer benefits and satisfaction. Such next generation modelling and simulation tools & methods empowering e.g. software-driven development automated engineering as well as credible simulation pave the way to make mobility safer more sustainable and more comfortable in a new way.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Design and validate digital tools for the automotive industry for enabling best possible combination of digital development and digital operation for innovative zero-emission solutions enabling up to 20% energy consumption reduction by e.g. deploying always latest software-driven energy saving functions becoming available during vehicles entire lifetime and to ensure performance security safety and reliability by design.Increase speed of innovation by optimising the utilisation of data (engineering operational infrastructure data etc.) in an effective and efficient way (synthesis and utilisation of data).Contribute to the development of solutions for reliable ‘virtual’ decision-making based on digital twins and for enhancement of the credibility of simulations based on process and artefact quality measures as well as KPI-driven quality assurance and traceability.Method and tools for reliable modelling and simulation of total vehicle systems including its environment.Significantly enhance the capabilities in design development and application of “software-defined” EV and thus strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry.Improve product quality improve decision making efficiency quality and exploiting operation data and thus contributing to the reduction of the overall development time.Scope:The data driven development of software-defined functions and systems of EVs (e.g. in context of battery and e-motor control predictive eco-driving functions or control of vehicle dynamics as well as comfort) requires the use of improved tools across domains (e.g. mechanical dynamic electrical and acoustical) and scales (from component to vehicle in a mobility scenario) as well as a deep understanding of the vehicle operation in real life.However the current development and design framework does not allow such complex software-defined functions and systems to be addressed in an integrated manner resulting often in solutions optimised for a specific operating point that is only partially representative of real use conditions and lacking the resource-efficient reuse of these solutions across multiple vehicle platforms. Moreover the development of vehicles that are constantly capable to adapt during lifetime (e.g. by remote programming capabilities) is also not sufficiently enabled. As such the scope of this call topic is expected to go far beyond today’s product development as addressed in previous Horizon 2020 topics (e.g. H2020-GV-2018 “Virtual product development and production of all types of electrified vehicles and components”).In order to fully exploit the potential of software-defined EV functions and vehicles an advanced dedicated digital development framework is needed. Proposals under this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:Design and validation of robust digital tools to efficiently and effectively develop complex EVs that are increasingly software-defined.Advanced methods for development of trustworthy (24/7 available secure safe) software-defined EV solutions.Promoting the use and adaption of conceptional tools and demonstrate integration into development frameworks for virtual approval (early demonstrators) that are applicable to all EV types considered in 2ZERO (from L-category to Heavy Duty vehicles).Concepts enabling the feedback to and use of all types of data (e.g. engineering data real-life operational data of EVs) in the product development of software-defined vehicle functions including automated update of the applied digital tools and models.Close collaboration is expected between selected projects under this topic and modalities need to be outlines in the proposal.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO). As such projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership ‘Towards zero emission road transport’ (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.,"Clean and competitive solutions for all transport modes (2023/24)This Destination addresses activities that improve the climate and environmental footprint as well as competitiveness of different transport modes.The transport sector is responsible for 23% of CO2 emissions and remains dependent on oil for 92% of its energy demand.
